a  given  Lender  has  not  consented  to  a  waiver  or  amendment  requiring  the  consent  of  all Lenders  and  to  which  the  Lenders  holding  an  aggregate  of  at  least  90%  of  the  Total Commitments have consented,
the  Borrower  may  (with  the  prior  consent  of  the  Majority  Lenders  and  subject  to  the  Intercreditor Agreement),  while  the  circumstance  giving  rise  to  the  requirement  for  that  increase  or indemnification continues, give the Agent notice of cancellation of the Commitment of that Lender and its intention to procure the repayment of that Lender's participation in the Loan.
On receipt of a notice referred to in paragraph (a) above in relation to a Lender, the Commitment of that Lender shall immediately be reduced to zero.
On  the  last  day  of  each  Interest  Period  which  ends  after  the  Borrower  has  given  notice  under paragraph (a) above in relation to a Lender (or, if earlier, the date specified by the  Borrower in that notice), the Borrower shall repay that Lender's participation in the outstanding Loan together with all interest and other amounts accrued under the Finance Documents.

if not settled in accordance with paragraph (i) above, be automatically  capitalised and shall constitute,  and  be  added  to  the  outstanding  principal  amount  of,  the  Loan  and  will  be subsequently treated for all purposes of this Agreement as part of the principal amount of the Loan.

(a) (b) (c) not a Qualifying Lender;
a Qualifying Lender (other than a Treaty Lender); or

For the avoidance of doubt, a Transfer Certificate  and  Lender  Accession  Undertaking  or  Assignment  Agreement  and  Lender  Accession Undertaking shall not be invalidated by any failure of a Lender to comply with this Clause 15.6.
15.7 Stamp taxes
The Borrower shall pay and, within three Business Days of demand, indemnify each Secured Party against any cost, loss or liability that Secured Party incurs in relation to all stamp duty, registration and other similar Taxes payable in respect of any Finance Document, provided that this Clause 15.7 shall  not  apply  in  respect  of  any  stamp  duty,  registration  or  similar  Taxes  which  are  payable  in respect  of  an  assignment,  transfer  or  other  alienation  of  any  kind  by  a  Lender  of  any  of  its  rights and/or obligations under a Finance Document unless the assignment, transfer or other alienation of any kind is made by a Lender in order to mitigate any circumstances giving rise to a Tax Payment, Increased Cost or a right to be pre-paid and/or cancelled by reason of illegality.
15.8  VAT
(a) (b) All  amounts  expressed  to  be  payable  under  a  Finance  Document  by  any  Party  to  a  Finance  Party which (in whole or in part) constitute the consideration for any supply for VAT purposes are deemed to  be  exclusive  of  any  VAT  which  is  chargeable  on  that  supply,  and  accordingly,  subject  to paragraph (b) below, if VAT is or becomes chargeable on any supply made by any Finance Party to any Party under a Finance Document and such Finance Party is required to account to the relevant tax authority for the VAT, that Party must pay to such Finance Party (in addition to and at the same time as paying any other consideration for such supply) an amount equal to the amount of the VAT (and such Finance Party must promptly provide an appropriate VAT invoice to that Party).
If VAT is or becomes chargeable on any supply made by any Finance Party (the  Supplier) to any other  Finance  Party  (the  Recipient)  under  a  Finance  Document,  and  any  Party  other  than  the Recipient (the Relevant Party) is required by the terms of any Finance Document to pay an amount equal to the consideration for that supply to the Supplier (rather than being required to reimburse or indemnify the Recipient in respect of that consideration):
(i) (ii) (where  the  Supplier  is  the  person  required  to  account  to  the  relevant  tax  authority  for  the VAT)  the  Relevant  Party  must  also  pay  to  the  Supplier  (at  the  same  time  as  paying  that amount) an additional amount equal to the amount of the VAT. The  Recipient must (where this paragraph (i) applies) promptly pay to the Relevant Party an amount equal to any credit or  repayment  the  Recipient  receives  from  the  relevant  tax  authority  which  the  Recipient reasonably determines relates to the VAT chargeable on that supply; and
(where  the  Recipient is the  person  required to  account  to the relevant tax authority  for the VAT) the Relevant Party must promptly, following demand from the Recipient, pay to the Recipient an amount equal to the VAT chargeable on that supply but only to the extent that the  Recipient  reasonably  determines  that  it  is  not  entitled  to  credit  or  repayment  from  the relevant tax authority in respect of that VAT.

(c)  Where  a  Finance  Document  requires  any  Party  to  reimburse  or  indemnify  a  Finance  Party  for  any cost or expense, that Party shall reimburse or indemnify (as the case may be) such Finance Party for the full amount of such cost or expense, including such part thereof as represents VAT, save to the extent  that  such  Finance  Party  reasonably  determines  that  it  is  entitled  to  credit  or  repayment  in respect of such VAT from the relevant tax authority.
(d) (e) Any  reference  in  this  Clause  15.8  to  any  Party  shall,  at  any  time  when  such  Party  is  treated  as  a member of a group for VAT purposes, include (where appropriate and unless the context otherwise requires)  a  reference  to  the  representative  member  of  such  group  at  such  time  (the  term "representative member" to have the same meaning as in the Value Added Tax Act 1994).
In  relation  to  any  supply  made  by  a  Finance  Party  to  any  Party  under  a  Finance  Document,  if reasonably  requested  by  such  Finance  Party,  that  Party  must  promptly  provide  such  Finance  Party with details of that Party's VAT registration and such other information as is reasonably requested in connection with such Finance Party's VAT reporting requirements in relation to such supply.
15.9 FATCA Information
(a) Subject to paragraph (c) below, each Party shall, within ten Business Days of a reasonable request by another Party:
(i) confirm to that other Party whether it is:

supply  to  that  other  Party  such  forms,  documentation  and  other  information  relating  to  its status  as  that  other  Party  reasonably  requests  for  the  purposes  of  that  other  Party's compliance with any other law, regulation, or exchange of information regime.

Paragraph (a) above shall not oblige any Finance Party to do anything, and paragraph (a)(iii) above shall  not  oblige  any  other  Party  to  do  anything,  which  would  or  might  in  its  reasonable  opinion constitute a breach of:

If  the  Agent  wishes  to  resign  because  (acting  reasonably)  it  has  concluded  that  it  is  no  longer appropriate  for  it  to  remain  as  agent  and  the  Agent  is  entitled  to  appoint  a  successor  Agent  under paragraph (c) above, the Agent may (if it concludes (acting reasonably) that it is necessary to do so in  order to persuade the  proposed  successor  Agent to  become  a  party  to this  Agreement as  Agent) agree with the proposed successor Agent amendments to this Clause 28 and any other term of this Agreement  dealing  with  the  rights  or  obligations  of  the  Agent  consistent  with  then  current  market practice  for  the  appointment  and  protection  of  corporate  trustees,  together  with  any  reasonable amendments to the agency fee payable under this Agreement which are consistent with the successor Agent's normal fee rates and those amendments will bind the Parties.
