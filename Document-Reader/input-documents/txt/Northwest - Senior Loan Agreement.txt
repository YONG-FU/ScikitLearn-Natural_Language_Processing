Each Senior  Lender  at  its  option  may  make  any Eurodollar Senior Loan by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Senior Lender to make such Senior Loan; provided that (i) any exercise of such option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay such Senior Loan in accordance with the terms of this  Agreement and (ii) the  making of such Eurodollar Senior Loan, through such domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Senior Lender will not result in any increased withholding or similar taxes or any other increased cost of borrowing payable by the Borrower.

(i)  The Senior Term Loan shall be drawn in a single Borrowing on the Closing Date
in an amount equal to the Aggregate Senior Term Loan Commitment.

Borrowings of more than one Type may be outstanding at the same time; provided that there shall  not  at  any  time  be  more  than  a  total  of  five  Eurodollar  Borrowings outstanding.
Limitations on Lengths of Interest Periods.   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Borrower shall not be entitled to request, or to elect to convert to or continue as a Eurodollar Borrowing if the Interest Period requested with respect thereto would end after the Final Maturity Date.
(d) 2.3 Requests for Borrowings

Appointment and Authorization of Administrative Agent
No  Senior  Financing  Party  may,  except  with  the  prior  consent  of  the  Required  Senior Lenders, (i) enforce any security interest created or evidenced by any Security Document or require the Administrative Agent to enforce any such security interest; (ii) sue for or institute any creditor's process (including an injunction, garnishment, execution or levy, whether before or after judgment) in respect of any Senior Obligation (whether or not for the  payment  of  money)  owing  to  it  under  or  in  respect  of  any  Senior  Loan  Document (other  than  the  exercise  of  the  right  of  set-off  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  this Agreement); (iii) take any step for the winding-up, administration of or dissolution of, or any insolvency proceeding in relation to, the Borrower, or for a voluntary arrangement, scheme of arrangement or other analogous step in relation to the Borrower, or (iv) apply for  any  order  for  an  injunction  or  specific  performance  in  respect  of  the  Borrower  in relation to any of the Senior Loan Documents.
Each  Senior  Financing  Party  hereby  irrevocably  appoints,  designates  and  authorizes  the Administrative Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and each other Senior Loan Document and to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are expressly  delegated  to  it  by  the  terms  of  this Agreement  or  any  other  Senior  Loan  Document, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.  Notwithstanding any provision to the  contrary  contained  elsewhere  herein  or  in  any  other  Senior  Loan  Document,  the Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth herein, nor shall the Administrative Agent have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with  any  Senior  Financing  Party  or  participant,  and  no  implied  covenants,  functions, responsibilities,  duties,  obligations  or  liabilities  shall  be  read  into  this  Agreement  or  any  other Senior Loan Document or otherwise exist against the Administrative Agent.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the use of the term agent herein and in the other Senior Loan  Documents  with  reference  to  the  Administrative  Agent  is  not  intended  to  connote  any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Governmental  Rule.    Instead,  such  term  is  used  merely  as  a  matter  of  market  custom,  and  is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties.

Certain Pledges.  Any Senior Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in  all  or  any  portion  of  its  rights  under  this  Agreement  to  secure  obligations  of  such Senior Lender, including any such pledge or assignment to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this  Section shall  not  apply  to  any  such  pledge  or  assignment  of  a  security  interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Senior Lender  from  any  of  its  obligations  hereunder  or  substitute  any  such  assignee  for  such Senior Lender as a party hereto.

Additional Provisions

In addition, the Borrower may in its reasonable judgment consent to the settlement  of  any  loss,  provided  that  in  the  event  that  the  amount  of  the  loss  exceeds $5,000,000 the terms of such settlement are approved by the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and any other parties to the Concession Agreement.
The  loss  payable  endorsement  described  in  the  previous  paragraph  shall  contain  non- vitiation  language  reasonably  acceptable  to  the  Administrative  Agent  (in  consultation with  the  Insurance  Consultant)  which  shall  provide  that  in  the  event  that  any  of  the insureds performs a vitiating act that might otherwise void coverage, the coverage will remain in full force and effect for the benefit of the Secured Parties.
3.4 (a) (b) (d) In the event that the Borrower fails in a timely and appropriate manner (as reasonably determined  by  the  Administrative  Agent  and  the  Collateral  Agent)  to  take  any  steps necessary or reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent to collect from any insurers for any loss covered by any insurance required to be maintained by this Exhibit G, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall have the right to make all proofs of loss, adjust all claims and/or receive all or any part of the proceeds of the foregoing insurance policies, either in its own name or the name of the Borrower; provided,  however,  that  the  Borrower  shall,  upon  the  Administrative  Agents  or  the Collateral Agents request and at the Borrowers own cost and expense, make all proofs

Policy Cancellation and Change.  All policies of insurance required to be maintained pursuant  to  this  Exhibit  G  shall  be  endorsed  so  that  if  at  any  time  they  should  be canceled, or coverage be reduced in any manner, such cancellation or reduction shall not be effective as to the Secured Parties for 60 days, except for non-payment of premium which shall be for 10 days, after receipt by the Administrative Agent of written notice from such insurer (or the Borrowers insurance broker) of such cancellation or reduction. Such  policy provisions  shall  also  provide  that  in  the  event  the  Insured  fails  to  pay  the premium, the Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent shall have the right (but not the  obligation)  to  pay  the  premium  and  continue  coverage  on  behalf  of  the  secured parties.

This provision may be satisfied through the use of an acceptable multi- insured endorsement.
Reinstatement or Replacement of Limits.  In the event that the insurance policies for this transaction are also insuring other assets that are not part of this transaction, in the event that limits or sub limits (including any aggregated limits or sub limits) are eroded due to losses at other locations, the Borrower shall immediately have the limits or sub limits reinstated or replaced for the benefit of the assets in this transaction.
Evidence of Insurance.  On the Closing Date and on an annual basis upon each policy anniversary,  the  Borrower  shall  furnish  the  Administrative  Agent  and  the  Collateral Agent  with  (i)  certification  of  all  required  insurance  marked  premium  paid  or accompanied by other evidence of payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent (in consultation with the Insurance Consultant) and (ii) a schedule of the insurance policies  held  by  or  for  the  benefit  of  the  Borrower  and  required  to  be  in  force  by  the provisions of this Exhibit G.
