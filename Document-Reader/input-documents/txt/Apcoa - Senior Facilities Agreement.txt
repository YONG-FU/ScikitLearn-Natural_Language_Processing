Determination") of (i) the Recovery Amount (such determination to take into
account the balance sheet adjustments set out in paragraph (a) above) and (ii)
an  estimate  of  the  liabilities,  damages,  costs,  fees  and  expenses  reasonably

German Guarantor shall be obliged to pay any such amount on demand.

23.12  Interpretation of guarantee for Austrian tax purposes and limitations in respect
of Austrian Obligors
(a) Notwithstanding  any  term  or  provision  of  this  Clause  23  (Guarantee  and
Indemnity)  or  any  other  term  in  this  Agreement  or  any  other  Finance
Document,  any  guarantee  or  indemnity  given  by  a  member  of  the  Group
incorporated in Austria (an "Austrian Obligor") under or in connection with
any  Finance  Document  is  meant  as  and  is  to  be  interpreted  as  an  abstract
guarantee  agreement  in  accordance  with  art  880a  of  the  (Austrian)  General
Civil  Code  (abstrakter  Garantievertrag  gem   880a  ABGB)  and  not  as  a
surety (Brgschaft) or joint obligation as a borrower (Mitschuldnerschaft) and
the Austrian Obligor undertakes to pay the amounts due under or pursuant to
such  guarantee  or  indemnity  unconditionally,  irrevocably,  upon  first  demand
and  without  raising  any  defences  (unbedingt,  unwiderruflich,  ber  erste
Anforderung und unter Verzicht auf alle Einwendungen).
(b) Any  and  all  liabilities  (Haftungen)  and  obligations  (Verpflichtungen)  of  an
Austrian Obligor under this Clause 23 (Guarantee and Indemnity) or any other
term  in  this  Agreement  or  any  other  of  the  Finance  Documents  shall  at  all
times be limited so that at no time shall the assumption of a liability (Haftung)
or obligation (Verpflichtung) under the Finance Documents be required if this
would  cause  an  Austrian  Obligor  to  violate  mandatory  Austrian  capital
maintenance  rules  (Kapitalerhaltungsvorschriften)  pursuant
to  Austrian
company law, in particular Sections 82 et seq. of the Austrian Act on Limited
Liability  Companies  (Gesetz  ber  Gesellschaften  mit  beschrnkter  Haftung  -
GmbHG) and/or Sections 52 and 65 et seq. of the Austrian Stock Corporation
Act  (Aktiengesetz  -  AktG)  (the  "Austrian  Capital  Maintenance  Rules").  If
any  liability  (Haftung)  or  obligation  (Verpflichtung)    of  an  Austrian  Obligor
under  any  Finance  Document  violates  or  contradicts  Austrian  Capital
Maintenance Rules and would therefore be held to be invalid or unenforceable
or should the assumption or enforcement of such obligation (Verpflichtung) or
liability  (Haftung)  expose  a  director  of  an  Austrian  Obligor  to  personal  or
criminal  liability,  such  obligation  (Verpflichtung)  or  liability  (Haftung)  shall
be  deemed  to  be  replaced  by  an  obligation  (Verpflichtung)  or  liability
(Haftung) of a similar nature (i) which is in compliance with Austrian Capital
Maintenance  Rules,  (ii) which  does  not  expose  the  managing  directors  or
members  of  the  supervisory  board  of  an  Austrian  Obligor  to  any  personal
liability or criminal responsibility; and (iii) which provides equivalent security
in favour of the Finance Parties. By way of example, should it be held that any
Transaction  Security  created  under  any  Finance  Document  contradicts
Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules in relation to any amount of the secured
obligations;  such  amount  will  be  reduced  to  an  amount  which  is  permitted

(c) If and to the extent the payment obligations of an Austrian Obligor under this
Clause  23  (Guarantee  and  Indemnity)  and/or  under  any  other  provision  in  a
Finance  Document  would  not  be  permitted  under  Austrian  Capital
Maintenance  Rules,  then  such  payment  obligations  shall  be  limited  to  the
maximum  amount  permitted  to  be  paid  under  Austrian  Capital  Maintenance
Rules, provided that the amount payable shall not be less than the aggregate of
(i) that Austrian Obligor's distributable balance sheet profit (including retained
earnings) (Bilanzgewinn) as defined in   224 (3)  lit  A no. IV of the Austrian
Enterprise Code (Unternehmensgesetzbuch  UGB) as calculated by reference
to the most recent (audited, if applicable) financial statements of that Austrian
Obligor  then  available  and  always  provided  that  the  shareholders  of  that
Austrian  Obligor  have  passed
the
relevant  distribution
resolution
(Ausschttungsbeschluss);  plus  (ii)  any  other  amounts  which  are  freely
available or can be converted into amounts freely available for distribution to
the  shareholder(s)  under  the  GmbHG  or  AktG  (as  the  case  may  be)  and  the
UGB (such as, for instance, unrestricted reserves (freie Rcklagen)) at the time
or  times  payment  under  or  pursuant  to  this  Clause  23  (Guarantee  and
Indemnity)  and/or  under  any  other  Finance  Document  is  requested  from  an
Austrian  Obligor  and  always  provided  that  the  shareholders  of  that  Austrian
Obligorhave
passed
the
relevant
distribution
resolution
(Ausschttungsbeschluss); plus, (iii) to the extent applicable, the equivalent of
the aggregate amount of all loans or other financial accommodation (plus any
accrued  interest,  commission  and  fees  thereon)  borrowed  by  that  Austrian
Obligor  in  its  capacity  as  Borrower;  plus  (iv)  (subject  to  paragraph (b))  the
equivalent of the aggregate loans or other financial accommodation (plus any
accrued interest, commission and fees thereon) borrowed by any other Obligor
under this Agreement and made available to such Austrian Obligor in form of
intercompany  financing  arrangements  (on-lending)  provided  that  the  amount
to be repaid by such Austrian Obligor under such financing arrangement may
be freely set-off against any reimbursement claims that such Austrian Obligor
has against such on-lending Obligor.
(d) The Company shall ensure that the shareholders of a relevant Austrian Obligor
resolve, promptly upon a payment request under or pursuant to this Clause 23
(Guarantee and Indemnity) and/or any other Finance Document in  respect of
an Austrian Obligor having been made and provided that an Event of Default
has  occurred  and  is  continuing,  (i)  that  the  Austrian  Obligor's  distributable
balance sheet profit (including retained earnings) (Bilanzgewinn) is distributed
to  the  shareholders,  and  (ii)  that  any  other  amounts  which  can  be  converted
into  amounts  freely  available  for  distribution  to  the  shareholders  under  the

Agreed Security Principles
1. AGREED SECURITY PRINCIPLES
a.
The  guarantees and security to  be provided will  be  given in  accordance  with
certain  agreed  security  principles  (the  "Agreed  Security  Principles").  This
Schedule  14  addresses  the  manner  in  which  the  Agreed  Security  Principles
will impact on the guarantees and security proposed to be taken in relation to
this transaction.
b.
The Agreed Security Principles embody a recognition by all parties that there
may  be  certain  legal  and  practical  difficulties  in  obtaining  effective  security
from all members of the Group in every jurisdiction in which members of the
Group are located.  In particular:
i.
general  statutory  limitations,  financial  assistance,  corporate  benefit,
fraudulent  preference,  "thin  capitalisation"  rules,  retention  of  title
claims and similar principles may limit the ability of a member of the
Group  to  provide  a  guarantee  or  security  or  may  require  that  the
guarantee be limited by an amount or otherwise;
ii.
iii.
a factor in determining whether or not security shall be taken is cost;
any assets subject to third party arrangements which may prevent those
assets from being charged will be excluded from any relevant security
document;
iv.
members of the Group will not be required to give guarantees or enter
into  security  documents  if  it  is  not  within  the  legal  capacity  of  the
relevant  members  of  the  Group  or  if  the  same  would  contravene  any
legal prohibition or could reasonably be expected to result in personal
or criminal liability on the part of any officer; and
v.
the giving of a guarantee, the granting of security or the perfection of
the  security  granted  will  not  be  required  if  it  would  have  a  material
adverse  effect  on  the  ability  of  the  relevant  Obligor  to  conduct  its
operations and business  in  the ordinary course as otherwise permitted
by the Finance Documents and would be unduly onerous.
Notwithstanding  the  above,  each  party  required  to  provide  Security  shall  use  its
reasonable  endeavours  to  overcome  any  of  the  above  difficulties  including,  but  not
limited to, complying with whitewash procedures or equivalent.
350 er express or implied, regarding Confidential Information.
b.
No failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising any right or remedy under
this letter will operate as a waiver of any such right or remedy or constitute an
election to affirm this letter.  No election to affirm this letter will be effective
unless it is in writing.  No single or partial exercise of any right or remedy will
prevent  any  further  or  other  exercise  or  the  exercise  of  any  other  right  or
remedy under this letter.

2. GUARANTEES AND SECURITY
a.
Each  guarantee  will be  an upstream,  cross-stream and downstream  guarantee
for all liabilities of the Obligors and Luxco 3 under the Finance Documents in
accordance  with,  and  subject  to,  the  requirements  of  the  Agreed  Security
Principles in each relevant jurisdiction.
b.
Where  Luxco  3  or  an  Obligor  pledges  shares,  the  security  document  will
(subject to agreed exceptions) be governed by the law of the company whose
shares are being pledged and not by the law of the country of the pledgor.
3. TERMS OF SECURITY DOCUMENTS
The following principles will be reflected in the terms of any security taken as part of
this transaction:
a.
to  the  extent  possible,  all  security  shall  be  given  in  favour  of  the  Security
Trustee  and,  to  the  extent  legally  required  under  local  law  in  the  relevant
jurisdiction, the Finance Parties. "Parallel debt" provisions will be used where
necessary;  such  provisions  will  be  contained  in  the  Intercreditor  Agreement
and not the individual Transaction Security Documents unless required under
local  laws.  With  respect  to  any  Austrian  law  security  created  under  Finance
Documents the joint and several creditorship shall apply, and accordingly the
Security Trustee shall be joint and several creditor of the obligations secured
by  the  respective  Austrian  Transaction  Security  Documents.  To  the  extent
possible, no action shall be required to be taken in relation to the guarantees or
Security when any Lender transfers any of its participation in the Facility to a
new Lender;
b.
security will not be enforceable until an Event of Default has occurred and the
Agent  has  notified  the  Company  of  that  occurrence  (or,  if  mandatory
provisions  of  the  governing  law  of  the  relevant  Transaction  Security
Documents  so  require,  until  any  of  the  secured  obligations  has  become  due
and payable);
c.
the  security  documents  should  only  operate  to  create  security  rather  than  to
impose  new  commercial  obligations.    Accordingly,  they  should  not  contain
any additional representations or undertakings (such as in respect of insurance,
information  or  the  payment  of  costs)  unless  these  are  the  same  as  those
contained  in  this  Agreement  or  are  covenants  required  for  the  creation,
perfection or protection of the security;
d.
in respect of the share pledges, until the security has become enforceable, the
pledgors  should  be  permitted  to  retain  and  to  exercise  voting  rights  to  any
shares  pledged  by  them  in  a  manner  which  does  not  adversely  affect  the
351 further  or  other  exercise  or  the  exercise  of  any  other  right  or
remedy under this letter.

under the Finance Documents;

refer  to  calculation  of  interest  payable,  this  should  be  calculated  at  the  rate

Documents  so  require,  until  any  of  the  secured  obligations  has  become  due
