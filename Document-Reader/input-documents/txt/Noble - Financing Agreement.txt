Upon receipt of any such request for payment from LC Fronting Bank, each Lender shall pay to LC Fronting Bank such Lenders Proportionate Share of the unreimbursed portion of such Drawing, together with interest thereon at a per annum rate equal to the Federal Funds Rate from the date of such Drawing to the date on which such Lender makes payment.  Each Lenders obligation to make each such payment to LC Fronting Bank shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence or continuance of any Default or Event of Default, or the failure of any other Lender to make any payment hereunder, and each Lender further agrees that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.  If any Reimbursement Payment is made by Borrower to Administrative Agent or LC Fronting Bank, Administrative Agent or LC Fronting Bank, as applicable, shall pay to each Lender which has paid its Proportionate Share of the Drawing such Lenders Proportionate Share of the Reimbursement Payment and

(e) Failure to Pay Administrative Agent.  Unless Administrative Agent shall have received notice from Borrower at least two (2) Banking Days prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Lenders hereunder that Borrower will not make such payment in full, Administrative Agent may assume that Borrower has made such payment in full to Administrative Agent on such date, and Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be distributed to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due such Lender.  If and to the extent Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to Administrative Agent, such Lender shall repay to Administrative Agent forthwith upon demand such amount distributed to such Lender, together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the date such Lender repays such amount to Administrative Agent, at a rate equal to the LIBO Rate.  A certificate of Administrative Agent submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing by such Lender under this Section 2.7(e) shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

Such Hedge Transactions shall be based upon the Amortization Schedule and shall have a termination date of the Term Loan Maturity Date.  Borrower shall give all bidders no less than two hours notice of its intent to hold a telephonic auction of any such Hedge Transaction.  Bids in such auction shall be binding on the bidder.

10.11  General Provisions as to Payments.  Administrative Agent shall
promptly distribute to each Lender its pro rata share of each payment of principal and interest payable to the Lenders on the Loans, DSRA LC Loans, the Energy Hedge LC Loan and fees hereunder received by Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders and of any other amounts owing under the Loans, DSRA LC Loans and the Energy Hedge LC Loan.  The payments made for the account of each Lender shall be made, and distributed to it, for the account of its Lending Office.
10.12  Substitution of Lender.  Should any Lender fail to make a Loan, or provide the forms or other documentation required by Section 2.7(d)(v) in violation of its obligations under this Agreement, or be unable to make LIBO Rate Loans due to an event occurring under Section 2.8(a) or Section 2.8(b), or claim increased costs under Section 2.8(c) or Section 2.8(d) (a Substitutable Lender), Administrative Agent (a) may in its sole discretion fund the Loan on behalf of the Substitutable Lender and (b) shall cooperate with Borrower or any other Lender to find another Person that shall be acceptable to Administrative Agent and that shall be willing to assume the Substitutable Lenders obligations under this Agreement (including the obligation to make the Loan which the Substitutable Lender failed to make but without assuming any liability for damages for failing to have made such Loan or any previously required Loan).  Subject to the provisions of the next following sentence, such Person shall be substituted for the Substitutable Lender hereunder upon execution and delivery to Administrative Agent of an agreement acceptable to Administrative Agent by such Person assuming the Substitutable Lenders obligations under this Agreement, and all interest and fees which would otherwise have been payable to the Substitutable Lender shall thereafter be payable to such Person.  Nothing in (and no action taken pursuant to) this Section 10.12 shall relieve the Substitutable Lender from any liability it might have to Borrower or to the other Lenders as a result of its failure to make such Loan.

2.  We have reviewed the material and data made  available  to  us  by  the  EPC  Contractor  and Borrower  since  the  date  of  the  last  Drawdown  Certificate,  which  information  consists  of: (a) the  executed  Drawdown  Certificate  (the  Current  Drawdown  Certificate),  dated [[_____]for  a  Borrowing  Date  of    [_____]  and  the  Appendices  and  other  items  attached thereto  prepared  by  the  Borrower  and/or  the  EPC  Contractor;  and  (b) work  progress documents consisting of monthly progress reports and other material related to the Projects as  we  believed  were  necessary  to  establish  the  accuracy  of  the  technical  aspects  of  the Current  Drawdown  Certificate.    We  last  visited  the  Site  (Bliss),  Site  (Clinton  I)  and  Site (Ellenburg) on  [_____], [_____], and  [_____], respectively.  Our review and observations were performed in accordance with generally accepted engineering practices in accordance with  the  standards  of  care  practiced  by  leading  independent  and  consulting  engineers  in performing  similar  tasks  on  like  projects.    We  have  reviewed  the  Current  Drawdown Certificate, and we have previously reviewed all previous Drawdown Certificates.
3.  To the extent practical within the scope of our engagement, we have periodically reviewed the progress of engineering, procurement and construction for the Projects and in the course of this review we have not discovered any errors or omissions of a technical nature in the claims  for  materials  that  have  been  procured  and  work  performed  under  the  Current Drawdown Certificate and all previous Drawdown Certificates.
4.  Based on the scope of our engagement, our review of the aforementioned information, and of data  provided  to  us  by  others  which  we  have  not  independently  verified,  we  are  of  the opinion that, as of the Borrowing Date:

PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS
Clinton I Project
Project (Clinton I) means the Noble Clinton Windpark I Wind Power project, when fully developed, an approximately 100.5 MW megawatt wind generation facility located approximately 3 miles south of the United States-Canadian border and 15 miles northwest of Plattsburgh, New York, within the city limits of Clinton, Clinton County, New York, including all structures or improvements erected on the Site (Clinton I), all alterations thereto or replacements thereof, all fixtures, attachments, appliances, equipment, machinery and other articles attached thereto or used in connection therewith and all Parts which may from time to time be incorporated or installed in or attached thereto, all contracts and agreements for the purchase or sale of commodities or other personal property related thereto, all real or personal property owned, easement granted upon or leased related thereto, and all other real and tangible and intangible personal property leased or owned by Noble Clinton Windpark I, LLC and placed upon or used in connection with the generation of electricity upon the Site (Clinton I); provided, however that Project (Clinton I) shall not include fixtures, attachments, appliances, equipment, machinery, systems or other articles or any other real or personal property or tangible or intangible property in connection with that certain operations center owned by Noble Wind Operations, LLC and located in Plattsburgh, New York.
The wind turbines that will be installed at Project (Clinton I) will be General Electric 1.5 MW, SLE, 80 Meter, MTS, T-Flange wind turbine generators.  The turbine is a three bladed, upwind, horizontal-axis wind turbine with a rotor diameter of approximately 253 feet. The nacelle is located at the top of each tower and contains the electrical generating equipment. The turbine rotor and the nacelle are mounted on top of a tubular tower giving a rotor hub height of 262 feet. The maximum height for the turbine is 388 feet 9 inches when a rotor blade is at the top of its rotation. Once installed, each wind turbine will occupy a round, slightly exposed base approximately 18 feet in diameter.
Project (Clinton I) involves the installation and operation of 67 wind turbines within an approximate 4,487-acre area in the Town of Clinton, New York and construction and use of approximately 17.2 miles of access roads. The actual Project (Clinton I) site is located on an approximate cumulative 60 acres within the 4,487-acre project area.  Land uses within the project area are a mixture of agricultural (1,701 acres) and forested land (1,986 acres). The project area also includes wetlands (842 acres) and surface waters (22 acres).  Current agricultural use is largely limited to hay production and pasture, although some row crops (e.g., corn) are grown throughout the area.
As part of Project (Clinton I) a new substation will be constructed on a 7.341-acre parcel that will tie into an existing 230-kilovolt (kV) New York Power Authority (NYPA) Plattsburgh

Willis line that will provide access to the grid that exists immediately south of the existing 230 kV transmission line ROW.
Bliss Project
Project (Bliss) means the Noble Bliss Windpark Wind Power project, when fully developed, an approximately 100.5 megawatt wind generation facility located approximately 30 miles southeast of Buffalo, New York, within the city limits of Bliss, Wyoming County, New York, including all structures or improvements erected on the Site (Bliss), all alterations thereto or replacements thereof, all fixtures, attachments, appliances, equipment, machinery and other articles attached thereto or used in connection therewith and all Parts which may from time to time be incorporated or installed in or attached thereto, all contracts and agreements for the purchase or sale of commodities or other personal property related thereto, all real or personal property owned, easement granted upon or leased related thereto, and all other real and tangible and intangible personal property leased or owned by Noble Bliss Windpark, LLC and placed upon or used in connection with the generation of electricity upon the Site (Bliss); provided, however that Project (Bliss) shall not include fixtures, attachments, appliances, equipment, machinery, systems or other articles or any other real or personal property or tangible or intangible property in connection with that certain operations center owned by Noble Wind Operations, LLC and located in Plattsburgh, New York.
The wind turbines that will be installed at Project (Bliss) will be General Electric 1.5 MW, SLE, 80 Meter, MTS, T-Flange wind turbine generators.  The turbine is a three bladed, upwind, horizontal-axis wind turbine with a rotor diameter of approximately 253 feet. The nacelle is located at the top of each tower and contains the electrical generating equipment. The turbine rotor and the nacelle are mounted on top of a tubular tower giving a rotor hub height of 262 feet. The maximum height for the turbine is 388 feet 9 inches when a rotor blade is at the top of its rotation. Once installed, each wind turbine will occupy a round, slightly exposed base approximately 18 feet in diameter.
The project involves the installation and operation of 67 wind turbines within an approximate 5,071 acre area in the Town of Eagle, New York and construction and use of approximately 16 miles of access roads. The actual Project (Bliss) site is located on an approximate cumulative 93 acres within the 5,071 acre project area.  Land uses within the project area are a mixture of agricultural (2,532 acres), forested land (2,475 acres), and developed land (3.5 acres).   The project area also includes wetlands (49 acres) and surface waters (11 acres). Current agricultural use is largely limited to hay production and pasture, although some row crops (e.g., corn) are grown throughout the area.  Forested land within the project area varies from recently clear-cut stands to late successional forests.
A 5.5 mile transmission line will be constructed within a separate 2,040 acre area to carry energy to the grid. The transmission line will be constructed and connected to a newly constructed switchyard, placed adjacent to the existing substation owned by the Village of Arcade in the Town of Arcade, New York. The switchyard provides interconnection to the grid.

Notice of Acceptance of Final EIS
Town of Clinton
*Note  Regarding  Unsatisfied  Conditions:    Many  permits  contain  conditions  that  require  ongoing  compliance  and,  thus,  can never be fully satisfied until such time as the permit is no longer required.  Failure to comply with such terms and conditions could result in each Project Company being subject to enforcement action, which could result in permit revocation, modification or termination  or  in  the  assessment  of  fines  and  penalties.    In  addition,  we  call  to  your  attention  that  several  permits  contain provisions requiring post-construction monitoring of environmental impacts (such as noise, shadows, and avian and bat impacts) and development and implementation of mitigation measures.  While Noble does not anticipate that the cost of any such mitigation will be material to any Project, the exact scope and cost of the mitigation measures cannot be determined at ths time.

*  Note Regarding Unsatisfied Conditions:  Many permits contain conditions that  require ongoing compliance and, thus, can never be fully satisfied until such time as the permit is no longer required.  Failure to comply with such terms and conditions could result in each Project Company being subject to enforcement action, which could result in permit revocation, modification or termination  or  in  the  assessment  of  fines  and  penalties.    In  addition,  we  call  to  your  attention  that  several  permits  contain provisions requiring post-construction monitoring of environmental impacts (such as noise, shadows, and avian and bat impacts) and development and implementation of mitigation measures.

PENDING LITIGATION
LW DRAFT JUNE 14, 2007
Noble Clinton I Wind Farm and Noble Ellenburg Wind Farm are the subject of a matter encaptioned, Neighbors for the Preservation of the North County, Inc. v. Town Board of the Town of Altona, Clinton County, et. al (Supreme Court, Clinton County, Index No. 2006- 001035).  In this proceeding, petitioners alleged that the approval of the Clinton County Projects by the Towns and the County Industrial Development Authority (IDA) did not comply with the requirements of the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA) and violated provisions of the State Open Meetings Law.  By a Decision and Order, dated March 8, 2007, Justice McGill of the Clinton County Supreme Court dismissed the petition in its entirety, finding that the Towns had taken the requisite hard look at the relevant environmental issues and that the preparation of a joint findings statement by the Towns (and subsequent reliance on that findings statement by the IDA) did not violate SEQRA.  The Court also found that the alleged violation of the Open Meetings Law was unsupported in the record.  On April 3, 2007, petitioners filed a Notice of Appeal requesting review of Justice McGills decision by the Appellate Division.

EXECUTION VERSION
HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES DISCLOSURE
1.  The New York Petroleum Bulk Storage and Historical Bulk Storage databases listed one registered aboveground waste oil tank on property near the Bliss site whose certification expired in 2006 and two registered underground storage tanks located near the western-central boundary of the Site whose certification expired in 2003.  Borrower cannot confirm the contents of these tanks or whether the tanks or their contents are presently in compliance with Hazardous Substances Law.  There is no indication from the database that these tanks leaked or caused any residual contamination.  The Environmental Report did not find the potential existence of these tanks to be a Recognized Environmental Condition ("REC").
2.  An area located at the intersection of Telegraph Road and Lyonsburg Road was listed on the New York Spills and Historic Spills database because  a number of 55-gallon drums had been found abandoned in the woods.  The NYSDEC database indicates that no spillage occurred.  In addition, the databases also indicate areas where there have been small Releases of fuel oil and hydraulic oil at or near the Bliss site.  Each of these incidents is reported to have been satisfactorily addressed.
3. Several areas of trash and debris were observed on or near the Bliss site. Visual observations included piles of trash and debris, including empty barrels/containers, white goods, tires, and abandoned cars in the following locations: (i) South side of access road between Turbines 40 and 41; (ii) South side of access road to Turbine 31; (iii) West bank of Clear Creek; and (iv) Intersection of access road leading to Turbine 34 and Caldwell Road.  Some stressed vegetation and slight odors were observed near Turbine 31.   The Environmental Report did not find these areas to be a REC.
4.  The database searches identified a diesel fuel spill that was discovered during a tank removal in December 1998 on Gagnier Road to the East of the Clinton site.  According to the database information, NYSDEC responded and corrective action were taken.  The Environmental Reports did not find this issue to be a REC.
5.Two areas of trash and debris (including empty barrels/containers, 55-gallon drums, and abandoned cars and farm equipment) were noted on or near the Clinton site on access roads leading to/from County Line road just west of Turbine 104 and west of Turbine 29 with no evidence of odors, oil sheens or stressed vegetation.  The Environmental Report did not find this observation to be a REC.
6.  Database search results identified the following items at or near the Ellenburg site: (i) a diesel spill in 1996 (at the intersection of Star Road and Brandy Brook Road) that NYSDEC responded to and corrective actions were taken; (ii)  a kerosene release (on Star Road west of Brandy Brook Road) in 2004 that NYSDEC responded to and no environmental impact was noted; (iii) a potential diesel spill at (7864 Star Road) in 2005 where NYSDEC responded and recommended no further corrective action; (iv) a gasoline spill (at 58 Brandy Brook Road) that received a spill closure in 1998 and (v) a governmental site where the US Army Corps of Engineers would take

CONVEYED TRANSMISSION OWNER FACILITIES
V
S
The Conveyed Transmission Owner Facilities the portion of the substation, interconnection, microwave and transmission facilities constructed or otherwise developed by NBW, NCW and/or NEW or an affiliate thereof, described below, which the applicable Project Companies contemplate selling, leasing, transferring, conveying or otherwise disposing of to NYPA, the Village of Arcade and Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation, as applicable, pursuant to the applicable Interconnection Agreements or the Engineering, Procurement and Construction Agreement between NBW, Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation, the Village of Arcade, New York and NYISO.
The following describes the work associated with the System Upgrade Facilities.  Noble Constructors, LLC, will design, construct, and furnish materials and equipment for the System Upgrade Facilities.
Microwave Communications System Upgrade Facilities
Additions and modifications to the existing NYPA microwave communications system will be made to support the operations of new substations for the Wind Turbine Facilities
The system will be comprised of a new digital microwave (backbone) system operating in the 6.7 GHz frequency band with two spur links operating in the 18.7 GHz frequency band and will interconnect with the existing NYPA digital microwave system at the NYPA Willis Substation on the west and terminating at the existing NYPA Plattsburgh Substation on the east.  This project will consist of the backbone system.  Attached drawing MIC-E-004 shows the proposed arrangement.
The backbone system will utilize existing towers at Willis and Plattsburg substation, and require a new 275 ft tower located in Altona called Big Hill and a new 195 ft tower in the new Ryan Substation.  The backbone link runs from Willis to Ryan to Big Hill to Plattsburg.  As part of Developer Attachment Facilties, spur links will run from Ryan to Marble River and from Big Hill to Duley.
The scope of work at each site will include the following:
Willis:
The new communications equipment will be housed in the existing building and the new antenna mounted on the existing tower.  The scope of work will include the following:
Tower Evaluation:  A structural evaluation of the existing tower and foundation for the new equipment will be performed to comply with NYPA and ANSI/TIA 222-G-2005 Class III standards.  The tower was originally designed for future additions so it is not anticipated that any reinforcement work will be required.  However, if the evaluation indicated enforcement is required, that work would be done prior to installation of the new equipment.  Evaluation will be performed by Transwave/Tower Technologies Inc.
Antennas:  A 6 ft diameter antenna to Ryan will be installed on the existing tower 199 ft above ground. The antenna will be furnished and installed by Transwave/Andrew.

EXECUTION VERSION
For the existing Willis Substation Equipment Plan see 176-W-6M02.  The existing Willis Substation Metering & Relaying One Line 176-W-9S01 is attached.  For the proposed Willis Substation One Line depicting the breaker additions and WP-1 and WP-2 changes see 070506-EE-1.  The plot plan is presented in Drawing 0705506-PL-1.
Phase 1
Changes at NYPA Willis substation for the MWP-2 Line
The existing MWP-2 line primary protection is a permissive overreaching transfer trip (POTT) system with unblocks logic, using Siemens 7SA522 numerical relay in conjunction with RFL 9745 audio tone equipment over ABB ETL 582 SBB/PLC channels.
The existing MWP-2 line secondary protection utilizes electromechanical relays to provide backup distance protection.
The primary and secondary protection will not essentially change, however, the existing breaker failure protection at Willis will need to be modified to trip the Ryan substation line breaker remotely.  To accomplish this scheme two DDTs will be required.  The first DDT-1 equipment required at Willis will include:
- One FSK PLC Transmitter - One phase C wave Trap - One Phase C Coupling Capacitor - One phase C Line Tuner
The second DDT-2 equipment will be a microwave link as described in the Microwave System description.
Changes at NYPA Willis substation for the MWP-1Line
The existing MWP-1 line primary protection is a blocking carrier scheme using electromechanical relays with CS27B carrier equipment.
