8. PAYMENT AND PREPAYMENT OF THE NOTES.
8.1 Required Prepayments and Maturity.
As provided therein, the entire unpaid principal balance of the Notes shall be due
and payable on the Maturity Date thereof.
8.2  Optional Prepayments with Make-Whole Amount.
The  Company  may,  at  its  option,  upon  notice  as  provided  below,  prepay  at  any time  all,  or  from  time  to  time  any  part  of,  the  Notes,  in  an  amount  not  less  than  5%  of  the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding in the case of a partial prepayment, at 100%  of  the  principal  amount  so  prepaid,  and  the  Make-Whole  Amount  determined  for  the prepayment date with respect to such principal amount.  The Company will give each Noteholder written notice of each optional prepayment under this Section 8.2 not less than 30 days and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for such prepayment.  Each such notice shall specify such  date  (which  shall  be  a  Business  Day),  the  aggregate  principal  amount  of  the  Notes  to  be prepaid on such date, the principal amount of each Note held by such Noteholder to be prepaid (determined in accordance with Section 8.3), and the interest to be paid on the prepayment date with respect to such principal amount being prepaid, and shall be accompanied by a certificate of a  Responsible  Officer  of  the  Company  as  to  the  estimated  Make-Whole  Amount  due  in connection  with  such  prepayment  (calculated  as  if  the  date  of  such  notice  were  the  date  of  the prepayment),  setting  forth  the  details  of  such  computation.    Two  Business  Days  prior  to  such prepayment, the Company shall deliver to each Noteholder a certificate of a Responsible Officer of  the  Company  specifying  the  calculation  of  such  Make-Whole  Amount  as  of  the  specified prepayment date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as no Default or Event of Default shall then exist, any prepayment made by the Company pursuant to this Section 8.2 of all of the Notes then outstanding on or after August 5, 2022 shall be made at 100% of the principal so prepaid, but without any Make-Whole Amount.
8.3 Allocation of Partial Prepayments.
In  the  case  of  each  partial  prepayment  of  the  Notes  pursuant  to  Section  8.2,  the principal amount of the Notes to be prepaid shall be allocated among all of the Notes at the time outstanding  in  proportion,  as  nearly  as  practicable,  to  the  respective  unpaid  principal  amounts thereof not theretofore called for prepayment.
8.4  Maturity; Surrender, Etc.
In  the case of each optional  prepayment of  Notes  pursuant to  this Section 8, the principal  amount  of  each  Note  to  be  prepaid  shall  mature  and  become  due  and  payable  on  the date fixed for such prepayment, together with interest on such principal amount accrued to such date  and  the  applicable  Make-Whole  Amount,  if  any.    From  and  after  such  date,  unless  the Company  shall  fail  to  pay  such  principal  amount  when  so  due  and  payable,  together  with  the interest  and  Make-Whole  Amount,  if  any,  as  aforesaid,  interest  on  such  principal  amount  shall cease  to  accrue.

8.5 Purchase of Notes.
The  Company  will  not,  and  will  not  permit  any  Affiliate  to,  purchase,  redeem, prepay or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, any of the outstanding Notes except upon the payment  or  prepayment  of  the  Notes  in  accordance  with  this  Agreement  and  the  Notes.    The Company will promptly cancel all Notes acquired by it or any Affiliate pursuant to any payment, prepayment  or  purchase  of  Notes  pursuant  to  this  Agreement  and  no  Notes  may  be  issued  in substitution or exchange for any such Notes.
8.6  Make-Whole Amount.
Make-Whole Amount means, with respect to any Note, an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the Discounted Value of the Remaining Scheduled Payments with respect to the Called Principal of such Note over the amount of such Called Principal, provided that the Make-Whole Amount  may  in  no  event  be  less  than  zero.    For  the  purposes  of  determining  the  Make-Whole Amount, the following terms have the following meanings:
Called Principal means, with respect to any Note, the principal of such Note that is to be  prepaid  pursuant  to  Section   8.2  or  has  become  or  is  declared  to  be  immediately  due  and payable pursuant to Section 12.1, as the context requires.
Discounted Value means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, the amount obtained by discounting all Remaining Scheduled Payments with respect to such Called Principal from  their  respective  scheduled  due  dates  to  the  Settlement  Date  with  respect  to  such  Called Principal, in accordance with accepted financial practice and at a discount factor (applied on the same periodic basis as that on which interest on the Notes is payable) equal to the Reinvestment Yield with respect to such Called Principal.
Reinvestment  Yield  means,  with  respect  to  the  Called  Principal  of  any  Note,  0.50% over the yield to maturity implied by the ask-side yield(s) reported as of 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the second Business Day preceding the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, on the display designated as Page PX1 (or such other display as may replace Page PX1)  on  Bloomberg  Financial  Markets  for  the  most  recently  issued  actively  traded  on-the-run U.S. Treasury securities (Reported) having a maturity equal to the Remaining Average Life of such Called Principal as of such Settlement Date.  If there are no such U.S. Treasury Securities Reported  having  a  maturity  equal  to  such  Remaining  Average  Life,  then  such  implied  yield  to maturity  will  be  determined  by (a)  converting  U.S.  Treasury  bill  quotations  to  bond  equivalent yields in  accordance with  accepted financial practice and (b)  interpolating linearly between the ask-side yield(s) Reported for the applicable most recently issued actively traded on-the-run U.S. Treasury Securities with the maturities (1) closest to and greater than such Remaining Average Life  and  (2)  closest  to  and  less  than  such  Remaining  Average  Life.

Treasury constant maturity yields reported, for the latest day for which such yields have been so reported  as  of  the  second  Business  Day  preceding  the  Settlement  Date  with  respect  to  such Called  Principal,  in  Federal  Reserve  Statistical  Release  H.15  (or  any  comparable  successor publication)  for  the  U.S.  Treasury  constant  maturity  having  a  term  equal  to  the  Remaining Average  Life  of  such  Called  Principal  as  of  such  Settlement  Date.    If  there  is  no  such  U.S. Treasury constant maturity having a term equal to such Remaining Average Life, such implied yield  to  maturity  will  be  determined  by  interpolating  linearly  between  (i)  the  U.S.  Treasury constant maturity so reported with the term closest to and greater than such Remaining Average Life  and  (ii)  the  U.S.  Treasury  constant  maturity  so  reported  with  the  term  closest  to  and  less than such Remaining Average Life.

Settlement Date means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, the date on which  such  Called  Principal  is  to  be  prepaid  pursuant  to  Section   8.2  or  has  become  or  is declared to be immediately due and payable pursuant to Section 12.1, as the context requires.

(b) If any other Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Required Holders may at any time at their option, by notice or notices to the Company, declare all the Notes then outstanding to be immediately due and payable.

12.2  Other Remedies.
If any Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and irrespective of  whether  any  Notes  have  become  or  have  been  declared  immediately  due  and  payable  under Section 12.1, any Noteholder may proceed to protect and enforce the rights of such Noteholder by  an  action  at  law,  suit  in  equity  or  other  appropriate  proceeding,  whether  for  the  specific performance of any agreement contained herein or in any Note or in any Subsidiary Guaranty, or for an injunction against a violation of any of the terms hereof or thereof, or in aid of the exercise of any power granted hereby or thereby or by law or otherwise.

This Guaranty shall not be affected by the genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the Obligations or any instrument or agreement evidencing any Obligations, or by  the  existence,  validity,  enforceability,  perfection,  non-perfection  or  extent  of  any  collateral therefor,  or  by  any  fact  or  circumstance  relating  to  the  Obligations  which  might  otherwise constitute a defense to the obligations of the Guarantor under this Guaranty, and  the Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any defenses it may now have or hereafter acquire in any way relating to  any  or  all  of  the  foregoing.    Anything  contained  herein  to  the  contrary  notwithstanding,  the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder at any time shall be limited to an aggregate amount equal to  the  largest  amount  that  would  not  render  its obligations hereunder  subject to  avoidance  as  a fraudulent transfer or conveyance under Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provisions of any similar federal or state law.
-34-
13.2  Rights of Noteholders.

The  Guarantor expressly  waives  all  setoffs  and  counterclaims  and  all  presentments,  demands  for  payment  or performance,  notices  of  nonpayment  or  nonperformance,  protests,  notices  of  protest,  notices  of dishonor and all other notices or demands of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the Obligations,  and  all  notices  of  acceptance  of  this  Guaranty  or  of  the  existence,  creation  or incurrence of new or additional Obligations.
13.4  Obligations Independent.
The obligations of the Guarantor hereunder are those of primary obligor, and not merely  as  surety,  and  are  independent  of  the  Obligations  and  the  obligations  of  any  other guarantor, and a separate action may be brought against the Guarantor to enforce this Guaranty whether or not the Company or any other Person or entity is joined as a party.
13.5  Subrogation.
The  Guarantor  shall  not  exercise  any  right  of  subrogation,  contribution, indemnity,  reimbursement  or  similar  rights  with  respect  to  any  payments  it  makes  under  this Guaranty until all of the Obligations (other than contingent indemnification obligations) and any amounts payable under this Guaranty have been indefeasibly paid and performed in full.  If any amounts  are  paid  to  the  Guarantor  in  violation  of  the  foregoing  limitation,  then  such  amounts shall  be  held  in  trust  for  the  benefit  of  the  Noteholders  and  shall  forthwith  be  paid  to  the Noteholders to reduce the amount of the Obligations, whether matured or unmatured.

-34-
13.6  Termination; Reinstatement.
This Guaranty is a continuing and irrevocable guaranty of all Obligations now or hereafter  existing  and  shall  remain  in  full  force  and  effect  until  all  Obligations  (other  than contingent indemnification obligations) and any other amounts payable under this Guaranty are indefeasibly paid in full in cash.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Guaranty shall continue in full  force  and  effect  or  be  revived,  as  the  case  may  be,  if  any  payment  by  or  on  behalf  of  the Company  or  the  Guarantor  is  made  in  respect  of  the  Obligations  and  such  payment  or  the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or  preferential,  set  aside  or  required  (including  pursuant  to  any  settlement  entered  into  by  any one or more of the Noteholders in their discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any debtor relief laws or otherwise, all as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred and whether or not the Noteholders are  in  possession  of  or  have  released  this  Guaranty  and  regardless  of  any  prior  revocation, rescission, termination or reduction.
13.7  Subordination.
The  Guarantor  hereby  subordinates  the  payment  of  all  obligations  and indebtedness of the Company owing to the Guarantor, whether now existing or hereafter arising, including but not limited to any obligation of the Company to the Guarantor as subrogee of the Noteholders  or  resulting  from  the  Guarantors  performance  under  this  Guaranty,  to  the indefeasible payment in full in cash of all Obligations.  If any Noteholder so requests, any such obligation or indebtedness of the Company to the Guarantor shall be enforced and performance received by the Guarantor as trustee for the Noteholders and the proceeds thereof shall be paid over to the Noteholders on account of the Obligations, but without reducing or affecting in any manner the liability of the Guarantor under this Guaranty.
13.8  Stay of Acceleration.
In the event that acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Obligations is stayed,  in  connection  with  any  case  commenced  by  or  against  the  Guarantor  or  the  Company under any debtor relief laws, or otherwise, all such amounts shall nonetheless be payable by the Guarantor immediately upon demand by the Noteholders.
13.9  Marshalling.
No Noteholder shall be under any obligation:  (a) to marshal any assets in favor of the Guarantor or in payment of any or all of the liabilities of the Company under or in respect of the Notes and this Agreement or the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder or (b) to pursue any other remedy that the Guarantor may or may not be able to pursue itself and that may lighten the Guarantors burden, any right to which the Guarantor hereby expressly waives.
13.10  Transfer of Notes.
All  rights  of  any  Noteholder  under  this  Section  13  shall  be  considered  to  be transferred or  assigned at any time  or  from time to  time upon the transfer of any Note held by

21. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
For  the  purposes  of  this  Section  21,  Confidential  Information  means information  delivered  to  any  Purchaser  by  or  on  behalf  of  any  Constituent  Company  or  any Subsidiary  in  connection  with  the  transactions  contemplated  by  or  otherwise  pursuant  to  this Agreement  that  is  clearly  identified  at  the  time  of  delivery  as  confidential,  provided  that  such term  does  not  include  information  that  (a)  was  publicly  known  or  otherwise  known  to  such Purchaser prior to the time of such disclosure, (b) subsequently becomes publicly known through no  act  or  omission  by  such  Purchaser  or  any  Person  acting  on  such  Purchasers  behalf,  (c) otherwise  becomes  known to  such  Purchaser other than through disclosure by the Company or any Subsidiary or (d) constitutes financial statements delivered to such Purchaser under Section 7.1  that  are  otherwise  publicly  available.

Each Noteholder, by its acceptance of a Note, will be deemed to have agreed to be bound by and to be entitled to the benefits of this Section 21 as though it were a party to this Agreement.  On reasonable request by a Constituent Company in connection with the delivery to any Noteholder of information required to be delivered to such Noteholder under this Agreement or requested by such Noteholder (other than a Noteholder that is a party to this Agreement or its nominee),  such  Noteholder  will  enter  into  an  agreement  with  the  Company  embodying  this Section 21.
In  the  event  that  as  a  condition  to  receiving  access  to  information  relating  to  a Constituent Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated by or otherwise  pursuant  to  this  Agreement,  any  Purchaser  or  Noteholder  is  required  to  agree  to  a confidentiality undertaking (whether through IntraLinks, another secure website, a secure virtual workspace  or  otherwise)  which  is  different  from  this  Section  21,  this  Section  21  shall  not  be amended  thereby  and,  as  between  such  Purchaser  or  such  Noteholder  and  the  Company,  this Section 21 shall supersede any such other confidentiality undertaking.
22. SUBSTITUTION OF PURCHASER.
Each  Purchaser  shall  have  the  right  to  substitute  any  one  of  its  Affiliates  or another  Purchaser  or  any  one  of  such  other  Purchasers  Affiliates,  in  each  case,  that  is  not  a Competitor  (a  Substitute  Purchaser)  as  the  purchaser  of  the  Notes  that  it  has  agreed  to purchase  hereunder,  by  written  notice  to  the  Constituent  Companies,  which  notice  shall  be signed  by  both  such  Purchaser  and  such  Substitute  Purchaser,  shall  contain  such  Substitute Purchasers agreement to be bound by this Agreement and shall contain a confirmation by such Substitute Purchaser of the accuracy with respect to it of the representations set forth in Section 6.  Upon receipt of such notice, any reference to such Purchaser in this Agreement (other than in this  Section  22),  shall  be  deemed  to  refer  to  such  Substitute  Purchaser  in  lieu  of  such  original Purchaser.

The Noteholders may enforce any remedy independently as to each Constituent Company and independently of any other remedy the Noteholders at any time may have or hold in connection with the Constituent Company Obligations, and it shall not be necessary for the  Noteholders  to  marshal  assets  in  favor  of  any  Constituent  Company  or  any  other Person or to proceed upon or against and/or exhaust any other remedy before proceeding to enforce this Agreement.

Each Constituent  Company  expressly  waives  the  benefit  of  any  statute(s)  of  limitations affecting  its  liability  under  this  Agreement  or  the  enforcement  of  the  Constituent Company  Obligations.

The enforceability of this Agreement at all times shall remain effective as to each Constituent Company as to the  Constituent  Company  Obligations  of  such  Constituent  Company  even  though  such Constituent  Company  Obligations,  including  any  part  thereof  may  be  or  hereafter  may become invalid or otherwise unenforceable as against any other Constituent Company or any other Person and whether or not any other Constituent Company or any other Person shall  have  any  personal  liability  with  respect  thereto.

If any of the waivers or consents herein are determined to be contrary to any applicable law or public policy, such waivers and consents shall be effective to the maximum extent permitted by law.

The loan may be prepaid six months prior to maturity, or any date therafter withoue a yield maintenance premium. The mortgage loan requires the replacement borrower be a single purpose entity (an "SPE").  One requirement of the SPE is that the interest of the Borrower cannot be consolidated with other assets of the borrower unless certain disclosures are made in the financial statements. The loan includes a requirement to either escrow or guarantee future tenant improvements.  To meet the requirements of the guarantee, TPF Equity Trust OP LP is required to hold $35 million in cash.
In event of prepayment after the closed period (2nd or 3rd loan years), a prepayment fee will be payable equal to the greater of 1% of the then outstanding principal indebtedness, or Yield Maintenance.  Yield Maintenance is defined as the exces of the present value on the date of prepayment of all remaining Monthly Payments and the outstanding principal of the loan and interest due on the Maturity date discounted at the yeild maintenance rate over the amount of principal of the loan being prepaid.  Yield Maintenance rate is the interest rate which, when compounded monthly, is the equivalent to the Treasury Yield plus 50 basis points.  If the loan is prepaid during the 4th year the prepayment fee shall be equal to 1% of the then-outstanding principal indebtedness.

Prepayment only allowed to the extent particpation is applied to principal.  See agreement for more details. Interest rate changes annually based on interest steps and new principal balance.  Participation is only considered interest expense up to a maximum effective interest rate of 5%.  Any participation over that amount is applied to principal.  Particpation is not known until after the year is complete.  As such the interest rate is based on the fixed interest payment divided by the current principal balance.  Loan is secured by the Lender's option to purchase the parking structures at the property.

The loan may be prepaid six months prior to maturity, or any date therafter withoue a yield maintenance premium. The mortgage loan requires the replacement borrower be a single purpose entity (an "SPE").  One requirement of the SPE is that the interest of the Borrower cannot be consolidated with other assets of the borrower unless certain disclosures are made in the financial statements. The loan includes a requirement to either escrow or guarantee future tenant improvements.  To meet the requirements of the guarantee, TPF Equity Trust OP LP is required to hold $35 million in cash.
In event of prepayment after the closed period (2nd or 3rd loan years), a prepayment fee will be payable equal to the greater of 1% of the then outstanding principal indebtedness, or Yield Maintenance.  Yield Maintenance is defined as the exces of the present value on the date of prepayment of all remaining Monthly Payments and the outstanding principal of the loan and interest due on the Maturity date discounted at the yeild maintenance rate over the amount of principal of the loan being prepaid.  Yield Maintenance rate is the interest rate which, when compounded monthly, is the equivalent to the Treasury Yield plus 50 basis points.  If the loan is prepaid during the 4th year the prepayment fee shall be equal to 1% of the then-outstanding principal indebtedness.

Prepayment only allowed to the extent particpation is applied to principal.  See agreement for more details. Interest rate changes annually based on interest steps and new principal balance.  Participation is only considered interest expense up to a maximum effective interest rate of 5%.  Any participation over that amount is applied to principal.  Particpation is not known until after the year is complete.  As such the interest rate is based on the fixed interest payment divided by the current principal balance.  Loan is secured by the Lender's option to purchase the parking structures at the property.

The loan may be prepaid six months prior to maturity, or any date therafter withoue a yield maintenance premium. The mortgage loan requires the replacement borrower be a single purpose entity (an "SPE").  One requirement of the SPE is that the interest of the Borrower cannot be consolidated with other assets of the borrower unless certain disclosures are made in the financial statements. The loan includes a requirement to either escrow or guarantee future tenant improvements.  To meet the requirements of the guarantee, TPF Equity Trust OP LP is required to hold $35 million in cash.
In event of prepayment after the closed period (2nd or 3rd loan years), a prepayment fee will be payable equal to the greater of 1% of the then outstanding principal indebtedness, or Yield Maintenance.  Yield Maintenance is defined as the exces of the present value on the date of prepayment of all remaining Monthly Payments and the outstanding principal of the loan and interest due on the Maturity date discounted at the yeild maintenance rate over the amount of principal of the loan being prepaid.  Yield Maintenance rate is the interest rate which, when compounded monthly, is the equivalent to the Treasury Yield plus 50 basis points.  If the loan is prepaid during the 4th year the prepayment fee shall be equal to 1% of the then-outstanding principal indebtedness.

Prepayment only allowed to the extent particpation is applied to principal.  See agreement for more details. Interest rate changes annually based on interest steps and new principal balance.  Participation is only considered interest expense up to a maximum effective interest rate of 5%.  Any participation over that amount is applied to principal.  Particpation is not known until after the year is complete.  As such the interest rate is based on the fixed interest payment divided by the current principal balance.  Loan is secured by the Lender's option to purchase the parking structures at the property.

Related Party Debt - Related Party Debt (where  TPF is lender and borrower)  has been excluded from  this schedule. Debt balances for Partnerships  are on a one month  lag with the exception of any partnerships  having a material change in the debt balance in the final month of the quarter.
Notes: (1) - TPF share is based on TPF's share of allocated available proceeds as of the most recent appraisal.  Debt sharing % may differ from the partnership ownership  percentage due to preferences or other special allocations of proceeds specified in the partnership agreement.  Percentage will be updated upon each appraisal. (2) - TPF share assumes  pro-rata allocation of all items in accordance w/pship  interests, based on pari passu partnership agreement. (3) - Partner's proceeds are to be used to pay-off the amount partner borrowed from LOC to fund partner's share of contributions.  The remainder of the debt is split based on waterfall sharing. (4) - Per the terms of the JV agreement, the other partner is fully responsible for debt repayment, so  the TPF allocable percentage is 0%.

The loan may be prepaid six months prior to maturity, or any date therafter withoue a yield maintenance premium. The mortgage loan requires the replacement borrower be a single purpose entity (an "SPE").  One requirement of the SPE is that the interest of the Borrower cannot be consolidated with other assets of the borrower unless certain disclosures are made in the financial statements. The loan includes a requirement to either escrow or guarantee future tenant improvements.  To meet the requirements of the guarantee, TPF Equity Trust OP LP is required to hold $35 million in cash.
In event of prepayment after the closed period (2nd or 3rd loan years), a prepayment fee will be payable equal to the greater of 1% of the then outstanding principal indebtedness, or Yield Maintenance.  Yield Maintenance is defined as the exces of the present value on the date of prepayment of all remaining Monthly Payments and the outstanding principal of the loan and interest due on the Maturity date discounted at the yeild maintenance rate over the amount of principal of the loan being prepaid.  Yield Maintenance rate is the interest rate which, when compounded monthly, is the equivalent to the Treasury Yield plus 50 basis points.  If the loan is prepaid during the 4th year the prepayment fee shall be equal to 1% of the then-outstanding principal indebtedness.

Prepayment only allowed to the extent particpation is applied to principal.  See agreement for more details. Interest rate changes annually based on interest steps and new principal balance.  Participation is only considered interest expense up to a maximum effective interest rate of 5%.  Any participation over that amount is applied to principal.  Particpation is not known until after the year is complete.  As such the interest rate is based on the fixed interest payment divided by the current principal balance.  Loan is secured by the Lender's option to purchase the parking structures at the property.

The loan may be prepaid six months prior to maturity, or any date therafter withoue a yield maintenance premium. The mortgage loan requires the replacement borrower be a single purpose entity (an "SPE").  One requirement of the SPE is that the interest of the Borrower cannot be consolidated with other assets of the borrower unless certain disclosures are made in the financial statements. The loan includes a requirement to either escrow or guarantee future tenant improvements.  To meet the requirements of the guarantee, TPF Equity Trust OP LP is required to hold $35 million in cash.
In event of prepayment after the closed period (2nd or 3rd loan years), a prepayment fee will be payable equal to the greater of 1% of the then outstanding principal indebtedness, or Yield Maintenance.  Yield Maintenance is defined as the exces of the present value on the date of prepayment of all remaining Monthly Payments and the outstanding principal of the loan and interest due on the Maturity date discounted at the yeild maintenance rate over the amount of principal of the loan being prepaid.  Yield Maintenance rate is the interest rate which, when compounded monthly, is the equivalent to the Treasury Yield plus 50 basis points.  If the loan is prepaid during the 4th year the prepayment fee shall be equal to 1% of the then-outstanding principal indebtedness.

Prepayment only allowed to the extent particpation is applied to principal.  See agreement for more details. Interest rate changes annually based on interest steps and new principal balance.  Participation is only considered interest expense up to a maximum effective interest rate of 5%.  Any participation over that amount is applied to principal.  Particpation is not known until after the year is complete.  As such the interest rate is based on the fixed interest payment divided by the current principal balance.  Loan is secured by the Lender's option to purchase the parking structures at the property.

The loan may be prepaid six months prior to maturity, or any date therafter withoue a yield maintenance premium. The mortgage loan requires the replacement borrower be a single purpose entity (an "SPE").  One requirement of the SPE is that the interest of the Borrower cannot be consolidated with other assets of the borrower unless certain disclosures are made in the financial statements. The loan includes a requirement to either escrow or guarantee future tenant improvements.  To meet the requirements of the guarantee, TPF Equity Trust OP LP is required to hold $35 million in cash.
In event of prepayment after the closed period (2nd or 3rd loan years), a prepayment fee will be payable equal to the greater of 1% of the then outstanding principal indebtedness, or Yield Maintenance.  Yield Maintenance is defined as the exces of the present value on the date of prepayment of all remaining Monthly Payments and the outstanding principal of the loan and interest due on the Maturity date discounted at the yeild maintenance rate over the amount of principal of the loan being prepaid.  Yield Maintenance rate is the interest rate which, when compounded monthly, is the equivalent to the Treasury Yield plus 50 basis points.  If the loan is prepaid during the 4th year the prepayment fee shall be equal to 1% of the then-outstanding principal indebtedness.

Prepayment only allowed to the extent particpation is applied to principal.  See agreement for more details. Interest rate changes annually based on interest steps and new principal balance.  Participation is only considered interest expense up to a maximum effective interest rate of 5%.  Any participation over that amount is applied to principal.  Particpation is not known until after the year is complete.  As such the interest rate is based on the fixed interest payment divided by the current principal balance.  Loan is secured by the Lender's option to purchase the parking structures at the property.

The loan may be prepaid six months prior to maturity, or any date therafter withoue a yield maintenance premium. The mortgage loan requires the replacement borrower be a single purpose entity (an "SPE").  One requirement of the SPE is that the interest of the Borrower cannot be consolidated with other assets of the borrower unless certain disclosures are made in the financial statements. The loan includes a requirement to either escrow or guarantee future tenant improvements.  To meet the requirements of the guarantee, TPF Equity Trust OP LP is required to hold $35 million in cash.
In event of prepayment after the closed period (2nd or 3rd loan years), a prepayment fee will be payable equal to the greater of 1% of the then outstanding principal indebtedness, or Yield Maintenance.  Yield Maintenance is defined as the exces of the present value on the date of prepayment of all remaining Monthly Payments and the outstanding principal of the loan and interest due on the Maturity date discounted at the yeild maintenance rate over the amount of principal of the loan being prepaid.  Yield Maintenance rate is the interest rate which, when compounded monthly, is the equivalent to the Treasury Yield plus 50 basis points.  If the loan is prepaid during the 4th year the prepayment fee shall be equal to 1% of the then-outstanding principal indebtedness.

Prepayment only allowed to the extent particpation is applied to principal.  See agreement for more details. Interest rate changes annually based on interest steps and new principal balance.  Participation is only considered interest expense up to a maximum effective interest rate of 5%.  Any participation over that amount is applied to principal.  Particpation is not known until after the year is complete.  As such the interest rate is based on the fixed interest payment divided by the current principal balance.  Loan is secured by the Lender's option to purchase the parking structures at the property.

The loan may be prepaid six months prior to maturity, or any date therafter withoue a yield maintenance premium. The mortgage loan requires the replacement borrower be a single purpose entity (an "SPE").  One requirement of the SPE is that the interest of the Borrower cannot be consolidated with other assets of the borrower unless certain disclosures are made in the financial statements. The loan includes a requirement to either escrow or guarantee future tenant improvements.  To meet the requirements of the guarantee, TPF Equity Trust OP LP is required to hold $35 million in cash.
In event of prepayment after the closed period (2nd or 3rd loan years), a prepayment fee will be payable equal to the greater of 1% of the then outstanding principal indebtedness, or Yield Maintenance.  Yield Maintenance is defined as the exces of the present value on the date of prepayment of all remaining Monthly Payments and the outstanding principal of the loan and interest due on the Maturity date discounted at the yeild maintenance rate over the amount of principal of the loan being prepaid.  Yield Maintenance rate is the interest rate which, when compounded monthly, is the equivalent to the Treasury Yield plus 50 basis points.  If the loan is prepaid during the 4th year the prepayment fee shall be equal to 1% of the then-outstanding principal indebtedness.

Prepayment only allowed to the extent particpation is applied to principal.  See agreement for more details. Interest rate changes annually based on interest steps and new principal balance.  Participation is only considered interest expense up to a maximum effective interest rate of 5%.  Any participation over that amount is applied to principal.  Particpation is not known until after the year is complete.  As such the interest rate is based on the fixed interest payment divided by the current principal balance.  Loan is secured by the Lender's option to purchase the parking structures at the property.

The loan may be prepaid six months prior to maturity, or any date therafter withoue a yield maintenance premium. The mortgage loan requires the replacement borrower be a single purpose entity (an "SPE").  One requirement of the SPE is that the interest of the Borrower cannot be consolidated with other assets of the borrower unless certain disclosures are made in the financial statements. The loan includes a requirement to either escrow or guarantee future tenant improvements.  To meet the requirements of the guarantee, TPF Equity Trust OP LP is required to hold $35 million in cash.
In event of prepayment after the closed period (2nd or 3rd loan years), a prepayment fee will be payable equal to the greater of 1% of the then outstanding principal indebtedness, or Yield Maintenance.  Yield Maintenance is defined as the exces of the present value on the date of prepayment of all remaining Monthly Payments and the outstanding principal of the loan and interest due on the Maturity date discounted at the yeild maintenance rate over the amount of principal of the loan being prepaid.  Yield Maintenance rate is the interest rate which, when compounded monthly, is the equivalent to the Treasury Yield plus 50 basis points.  If the loan is prepaid during the 4th year the prepayment fee shall be equal to 1% of the then-outstanding principal indebtedness.

Prepayment only allowed to the extent particpation is applied to principal.  See agreement for more details. Interest rate changes annually based on interest steps and new principal balance.  Participation is only considered interest expense up to a maximum effective interest rate of 5%.  Any participation over that amount is applied to principal.  Particpation is not known until after the year is complete.  As such the interest rate is based on the fixed interest payment divided by the current principal balance.  Loan is secured by the Lender's option to purchase the parking structures at the property.

The loan may be prepaid six months prior to maturity, or any date therafter withoue a yield maintenance premium. The mortgage loan requires the replacement borrower be a single purpose entity (an "SPE").  One requirement of the SPE is that the interest of the Borrower cannot be consolidated with other assets of the borrower unless certain disclosures are made in the financial statements. The loan includes a requirement to either escrow or guarantee future tenant improvements.  To meet the requirements of the guarantee, TPF Equity Trust OP LP is required to hold $35 million in cash.
In event of prepayment after the closed period (2nd or 3rd loan years), a prepayment fee will be payable equal to the greater of 1% of the then outstanding principal indebtedness, or Yield Maintenance.  Yield Maintenance is defined as the exces of the present value on the date of prepayment of all remaining Monthly Payments and the outstanding principal of the loan and interest due on the Maturity date discounted at the yeild maintenance rate over the amount of principal of the loan being prepaid.  Yield Maintenance rate is the interest rate which, when compounded monthly, is the equivalent to the Treasury Yield plus 50 basis points.  If the loan is prepaid during the 4th year the prepayment fee shall be equal to 1% of the then-outstanding principal indebtedness.

Prepayment only allowed to the extent particpation is applied to principal.  See agreement for more details. Interest rate changes annually based on interest steps and new principal balance.  Participation is only considered interest expense up to a maximum effective interest rate of 5%.  Any participation over that amount is applied to principal.  Particpation is not known until after the year is complete.  As such the interest rate is based on the fixed interest payment divided by the current principal balance.  Loan is secured by the Lender's option to purchase the parking structures at the property.

The loan may be prepaid six months prior to maturity, or any date therafter withoue a yield maintenance premium. The mortgage loan requires the replacement borrower be a single purpose entity (an "SPE").  One requirement of the SPE is that the interest of the Borrower cannot be consolidated with other assets of the borrower unless certain disclosures are made in the financial statements. The loan includes a requirement to either escrow or guarantee future tenant improvements.  To meet the requirements of the guarantee, TPF Equity Trust OP LP is required to hold $35 million in cash.
In event of prepayment after the closed period (2nd or 3rd loan years), a prepayment fee will be payable equal to the greater of 1% of the then outstanding principal indebtedness, or Yield Maintenance.  Yield Maintenance is defined as the exces of the present value on the date of prepayment of all remaining Monthly Payments and the outstanding principal of the loan and interest due on the Maturity date discounted at the yeild maintenance rate over the amount of principal of the loan being prepaid.  Yield Maintenance rate is the interest rate which, when compounded monthly, is the equivalent to the Treasury Yield plus 50 basis points.  If the loan is prepaid during the 4th year the prepayment fee shall be equal to 1% of the then-outstanding principal indebtedness.

Prepayment only allowed to the extent particpation is applied to principal.  See agreement for more details. Interest rate changes annually based on interest steps and new principal balance.  Participation is only considered interest expense up to a maximum effective interest rate of 5%.  Any participation over that amount is applied to principal.  Particpation is not known until after the year is complete.  As such the interest rate is based on the fixed interest payment divided by the current principal balance.  Loan is secured by the Lender's option to purchase the parking structures at the property.

The loan may be prepaid six months prior to maturity, or any date therafter withoue a yield maintenance premium. The mortgage loan requires the replacement borrower be a single purpose entity (an "SPE").  One requirement of the SPE is that the interest of the Borrower cannot be consolidated with other assets of the borrower unless certain disclosures are made in the financial statements. The loan includes a requirement to either escrow or guarantee future tenant improvements.  To meet the requirements of the guarantee, TPF Equity Trust OP LP is required to hold $35 million in cash.
In event of prepayment after the closed period (2nd or 3rd loan years), a prepayment fee will be payable equal to the greater of 1% of the then outstanding principal indebtedness, or Yield Maintenance.  Yield Maintenance is defined as the exces of the present value on the date of prepayment of all remaining Monthly Payments and the outstanding principal of the loan and interest due on the Maturity date discounted at the yeild maintenance rate over the amount of principal of the loan being prepaid.  Yield Maintenance rate is the interest rate which, when compounded monthly, is the equivalent to the Treasury Yield plus 50 basis points.  If the loan is prepaid during the 4th year the prepayment fee shall be equal to 1% of the then-outstanding principal indebtedness.

Prepayment only allowed to the extent particpation is applied to principal.  See agreement for more details. Interest rate changes annually based on interest steps and new principal balance.  Participation is only considered interest expense up to a maximum effective interest rate of 5%.  Any participation over that amount is applied to principal.  Particpation is not known until after the year is complete.  As such the interest rate is based on the fixed interest payment divided by the current principal balance.  Loan is secured by the Lender's option to purchase the parking structures at the property.

The loan may be prepaid six months prior to maturity, or any date therafter withoue a yield maintenance premium. The mortgage loan requires the replacement borrower be a single purpose entity (an "SPE").  One requirement of the SPE is that the interest of the Borrower cannot be consolidated with other assets of the borrower unless certain disclosures are made in the financial statements. The loan includes a requirement to either escrow or guarantee future tenant improvements.  To meet the requirements of the guarantee, TPF Equity Trust OP LP is required to hold $35 million in cash.
In event of prepayment after the closed period (2nd or 3rd loan years), a prepayment fee will be payable equal to the greater of 1% of the then outstanding principal indebtedness, or Yield Maintenance.  Yield Maintenance is defined as the exces of the present value on the date of prepayment of all remaining Monthly Payments and the outstanding principal of the loan and interest due on the Maturity date discounted at the yeild maintenance rate over the amount of principal of the loan being prepaid.  Yield Maintenance rate is the interest rate which, when compounded monthly, is the equivalent to the Treasury Yield plus 50 basis points.  If the loan is prepaid during the 4th year the prepayment fee shall be equal to 1% of the then-outstanding principal indebtedness.

Prepayment only allowed to the extent particpation is applied to principal.  See agreement for more details. Interest rate changes annually based on interest steps and new principal balance.  Participation is only considered interest expense up to a maximum effective interest rate of 5%.  Any participation over that amount is applied to principal.  Particpation is not known until after the year is complete.  As such the interest rate is based on the fixed interest payment divided by the current principal balance.  Loan is secured by the Lender's option to purchase the parking structures at the property.
