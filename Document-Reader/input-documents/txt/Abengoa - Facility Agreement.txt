SECTION 5
COSTS OF UTILISATION
8. 8.1 INTEREST
PIK interest
Interest shall, commencing on the Utilisation Date of the Loan, accrue daily on the Loan at a rate equal to the aggregate of:
(a) (b) the PIK Margin; and
LIBOR,
and  such  interest  shall  be  automatically  capitalised  and  shall  be  added  to  the outstanding principal amount of the Loan on the last day of each Interest Period such that  each  Lender's  participation  in  the  Loan  shall  increase  by  an  amount  of  such accrued  interest  which  is  equal  to  the  proportion  borne  by  its  Commitment  to  the relevant Total Commitments immediately prior to such capitalisation.  Any accrued interest  that  is  capitalised  shall,  after  being  so  capitalised,  be  treated  as  part  of  the principal  amount  of  the  Loan,  shall  bear  interest  in  accordance  with  this  Clause 8 (Interest)  and  shall  be  payable  in  accordance  with  the  repayment  or  prepayment provisions of this Agreement.
8.2 Default interest
(a) If  the  Borrower  fails  to  pay  any  amount  payable  by  it  under  a  Finance Document on its due date, interest shall accrue on the overdue amount from the due date up to the date of actual payment (both before and after judgment) at  a  rate  which,  subject  to  paragraph (b)  below,  is  five  per  cent.  per  annum higher than the rate which would have accrued under Clause 8.1 (PIK interest) if  the  overdue  amount  had,  during  the  period  of  non-payment,  constituted  a Loan in the currency of the overdue amount for successive  Interest Periods, each  of  a  duration  selected  by  the  Agent  (acting  reasonably).    Any  interest accruing under this Clause 8.2 shall be immediately payable by the Borrower on demand by the Agent.
(b) If any overdue amount consists of all or part of the Loan which became due on a day which was not the last day of an Interest Period relating to the Loan:
(i) (ii) the first Interest Period for that overdue amount shall have a duration equal to the unexpired portion of the current Interest Period relating to the Loan; and
the  rate  of  interest  applying  to  the  overdue  amount  during  that  first Interest Period shall be five per cent. per annum higher than the rate which  would  have  accrued  under  Clause 8.1  (PIK  interest)  if  the overdue amount had not become due.
(c) Default interest (if unpaid) arising on an overdue amount will be compounded with the overdue amount at the end of each Interest Period applicable to that overdue amount but will remain immediately due and payable.

INTEREST PERIODS
Duration
8.3 9. 9.1 (a) (b) (c) (d) Subject to paragraph (d) below, each Interest Period will be one Month.
An Interest Period for the Loan shall not extend beyond the Maturity Date.
Subject to paragraph (d) below, the Interest Period for the Loan shall start on the  Utilisation  Date  for the  Loan  or  (if  already  made)  on  the  last  day  of  its preceding Interest Period.
If any Lender advances an amount equal to its participation in any proposed Loan  to  the  Agent  prior  to  a  Utilisation  Date  but  after  the  submission  of  a Utilisation Request, such amount will accrue interest on the same terms as it would had it been a Loan under the Facility from the date of receipt by the Agent, with:
(i) (ii) an Interest Period starting on the date of such advance to the Agent and ending on the same date as the first Interest Period under the Facility; and
LIBOR in respect of such advance being the same as that for the first Interest Period under the Facility.
9.2 Non-Business Days
If an Interest Period would otherwise end on a day which is not a Business Day, that Interest Period will instead end on the next Business Day in that calendar month (if there is one) or the preceding Business Day (if there is not).
10. CHANGES TO THE CALCULATION OF INTEREST
10.1  Unavailability of Screen Rate
(a) Interpolated Screen Rate:  If no Screen Rate is available for LIBOR for the Interest Period of the Loan, LIBOR shall be the Interpolated Screen Rate for a period equal in length to the Interest Period of the Loan.

(c) Default interest (if unpaid) arising on an overdue amount will be compounded with the overdue amount at the end of each Interest Period applicable to that overdue amount but will remain immediately due and payable.

Each Obligor shall promptly upon becoming aware that it must make a Tax Deduction  (or  that  there  is  any  change  in  the  rate  or  the  basis  of  a  Tax Deduction) notify the Agent accordingly.  Similarly, a Lender shall notify the Agent on becoming so aware in respect of a payment payable to that Lender. If  the  Agent  receives  such  notification  from  a  Lender  it  shall  notify  the Borrower and that Obligor.
If a Tax Deduction is required by law to be made by an Obligor, the amount of the  payment  due  from  that  Obligor  shall  be  increased  to  an  amount  which (after  making  any  Tax  Deduction)  leaves  an  amount  equal  to  the  payment which would have been due if no Tax Deduction had been required.
A  payment  shall  not  be increased  under  paragraph (c)  above  by  reason  of  a Tax Deduction on account of Tax imposed by the United Kingdom, if on the date on which the payment falls due:
(i) the payment  could have been made to the relevant  Lender without  a Tax Deduction if the Lender had been a Qualifying Lender, but on that date that Lender is not or has ceased to be a Qualifying Lender other than as a result of any change after the date it became a Lender under this  Agreement  in  (or  in  the  interpretation,  administration,  or application  of)  any  law  or  Treaty  or  any  published  practice  or published concession of any relevant taxing authority; or
(ii) the  relevant  Lender  is  a  Qualifying  Lender  solely  by  virtue  of paragraph (i)(B) of the definition of "Qualifying Lender" and:
(A) an  officer  of  HM  Revenue  &  Customs  has  given  (and  not revoked)  a  direction  (a  "Direction")  under  section  931  of  the ITA which relates to the payment and that Lender has received from the Obligor making the payment or from the Borrower a certified copy of that Direction; and
(B) the payment could have been made to the Lender without any Tax Deduction if that Direction had not been made; or
(iii) the  relevant  Lender  is  a  Qualifying  Lender  solely  by  virtue  of paragraph (i)(B) of the definition of "Qualifying Lender"; and

(b) If VAT is or becomes chargeable on any supply made by any Finance Party (the "Supplier") to any other Finance Party (the "Recipient") under a Finance Document, and any Party other than the Recipient (the "Relevant Party") is required by the terms of any Finance Document to pay an amount equal to the consideration  for  that  supply  to  the  Supplier  (rather  than  being  required  to reimburse or indemnify the Recipient in respect of that consideration):

The  Recipient  must  (where  this paragraph (i)  applies)  promptly  pay  to  the  Relevant  Party  an  amount equal  to  any  credit  or  repayment  the  Recipient  receives  from  the relevant  tax  authority  which  the  Recipient  reasonably  determines relates to the VAT chargeable on that supply; and
(where the Recipient is the person required to account to the relevant tax  authority  for  the  VAT)  the  Relevant  Party  must  promptly, following demand from the Recipient, pay to the Recipient an amount equal to the VAT chargeable on that supply but only to the extent that the Recipient reasonably determines that it is not entitled to credit or repayment from the relevant tax authority in respect of that VAT.

SECTION 7 GUARANTEE
17.  GUARANTEE AND INDEMNITY
17.1  Guarantee and indemnity
Each Guarantor irrevocably and unconditionally jointly and severally:
(a) (b) (c) guarantees to each Finance Party punctual performance by the Borrower of all the Borrower's obligations under the Finance Documents;
undertakes with each Finance Party that whenever the Borrower does not pay any  amount  when  due  under  or  in  connection  with  any  Finance  Document, that Guarantor shall immediately on demand pay that amount as if it was the principal obligor; and
agrees  with  each  Finance  Party  that  if  any  obligation  guaranteed  by  it  is  or becomes  unenforceable,  invalid  or  illegal  it  will,  as  an  independent  and primary  obligation,  indemnify  that  Finance  Party  immediately  on  demand against any cost, loss or liability it incurs as a result of a Borrower not paying any amount which would, but for such unenforceability, invalidity or illegality, have  been  payable  by  it  under  any  Finance  Document  on  the  date  when  it would  have  been  due.    The  amount  payable  by  a  Guarantor  under  this indemnity  will  not  exceed  the  amount  it  would  have  had  to  pay  under  this Clause 17  if  the  amount  claimed  had  been  recoverable  on  the  basis  of  a guarantee.
17.2  Continuing guarantee
This guarantee is a continuing guarantee and will extend to the ultimate balance of sums  payable  by  any  Obligor  under  the  Finance  Documents,  regardless  of  any intermediate payment or discharge in whole or in part.
17.3  Reinstatement
If any discharge, release or arrangement (whether in respect of the obligations of any Obligor or any security for those obligations or otherwise) is made by a Finance Party in whole or in part on the basis of any payment, security or other disposition which is avoided or must be restored in insolvency, liquidation, administration or otherwise, without  limitation,  then  the  liability  of  each  Guarantor  under  this  Clause 17  will continue or be reinstated as if the discharge, release or arrangement had not occurred.
17.4  Waiver of defences
The obligations of each Guarantor under this Clause 17 will not be affected by an act, omission,  matter  or  thing  which,  but  for  this  Clause,  would  reduce,  release  or prejudice any of its obligations under this Clause 17 (without limitation and whether or not known to it or any Finance Party) including:
(a) any time, waiver or consent granted to, or composition with, any Obligor or other person;

17.6 Immediate recourse
Each Guarantor waives any right it may have of first requiring any Finance Party (or any trustee or agent on its behalf) to proceed against or enforce any other rights or security or claim payment from any person before claiming from that Guarantor under this  Clause 17.    This  waiver  applies  irrespective  of  any  law  or  any  provision  of  a Finance Document to the contrary.

17.7  Appropriations
Until  all  amounts  which  may  be  or  become  payable  by  the  Obligors  under  or  in connection  with  the  Finance  Documents  have  been  irrevocably  paid  in  full,  each Finance Party (or any trustee or agent on its behalf) may:
(a) refrain from applying or enforcing any other moneys, security or rights held or received by that Finance Party (or any trustee or agent on its behalf) in respect of those amounts, or apply and enforce the same in such manner and order as it sees fit (whether against those amounts or otherwise) and no Guarantor shall be entitled to the benefit of the same; and
(b) hold in an interest-bearing suspense  account any  moneys received from any Guarantor or on account of any Guarantor's liability under this Clause 17.
17.8  Deferral of Guarantors' rights

(b) On and from the date of creation of the relevant Transaction Security, neither the  creation  nor  the  enforcement  of  Transaction  Security  over  any  Shares would (and could not reasonably be expected to):
(i) (ii) (iii) (iv) (v) constitute a breach by the Borrower of any shareholders' (or similar) agreement;
cause any person to be in breach of its obligations under any rules or regulations applicable in any Relevant Jurisdiction;
oblige any person to make a mandatory offer for any Shares;
inhibit  the  Company  from  exercising  control  over  any  of  its Subsidiaries; or
otherwise  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  the  business,  operations, property or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company.
On  and  from  the  date  of  creation  of  the  relevant  Transaction  Security,  the creation of the Transaction Security over any Shares would not (and could not reasonably be expected to) trigger any right of any person to request that any Financial Indebtedness of the Borrower or the Company be prepaid or declare Financial Indebtedness of the Borrower or the Company due and payable prior to its specified maturity.
The Borrower has beneficially owned the Reference Shares for more than one year.
The Borrower is not, and, to the best of its knowledge and belief no member of the ABY Group is, party to any agreement or arrangements (other than the ACBH Dividend Deferral Arrangements) which could reasonably be expected to prevent or reduce the amount of, or defer or delay the payment of, all or any part of the dividends payable by the Company to the Borrower in respect of the Reference Shares.
The ownership or rights of a holder of the Reference Shares are not affected by  any  agreement  or  arrangement  (other  than  the  ACBH  Dividend  Deferral Arrangements,  pursuant  to  the  Finance  Documents,  the  September  2015 Facility,  the  December  2015  Facility,  the  March  2016  Facility  and,  on  and before Completion, the TCI Margin Loan).
It  could  not  reasonably  be  expected  that  any  member  of  the  ABY  Group would be liable for any material Tax liabilities in the event of any disposal at any time of all or some of the Reference Shares by way of enforcement of the Transaction Security.
The ACBH Deferred Dividend Arrangement automatically ceases to apply in respect of any Reference Shares at any time at which they cease to be owned by a member of the Group.

26.13  Resignation of the Agent or Calculation Agent
(a) (b) (c) (d) (e) The  Agent  may  resign  and  appoint  one  of  its  Affiliates  acting  through  an office  in  the  United  Kingdom  as  successor  by  giving  notice  to  the  other Finance Parties and the Borrower.
Alternatively, the Agent may  resign by  giving five Business Days' notice to the  other  Finance  Parties  and  the  Borrower,  in  which  case  the  Majority Lenders (after consultation with the Borrower) may appoint a successor Agent.
If the Majority Lenders have not appointed a successor Agent in accordance with paragraph (b)  above within twenty  days after notice of resignation was given, the retiring Agent (after consultation with the Borrower) may appoint a successor Agent acting through an office in the United Kingdom.
If the Agent wishes to resign because (acting reasonably) it has concluded that it is no longer appropriate for it to remain as agent and the Agent is entitled to appoint  a  successor  Agent  under  paragraph  (c)  above,  the  Agent  may  (if  it concludes (acting reasonably) that it is necessary to do so in order to persuade the proposed successor Agent to become a party to this Agreement as Agent) agree with the proposed successor Agent amendments to this Clause 26 and any other term of this Agreement dealing with the rights or obligations of the Agent  consistent  with  then  current  market  practice  for  the  appointment  and protection of corporate trustees together with any reasonable amendments to the  agency  fee  payable  under  this  Agreement  which  are  consistent  with  the successor Agent's normal fee rates and those amendments will bind the Parties.
The  retiring  Agent  shall  make  available  to  the  successor  Agent  such documents  and  records  and  provide  such  assistance  as  the  successor  Agent may reasonably request for the purposes of performing its functions as Agent under  the  Finance  Documents.    Without  prejudice  to  the  generality  of  the foregoing,  the  retiring  Agent  shall  do,  or  permit  to  be  done,  all  such  acts (including making filings and registrations) and execute and deliver all such documents  (including  stock  transfer  forms)  as  the  successor  Agent  may specify for the purpose of transferring the Veto Share to the successor Agent. The  Borrower  irrevocably  consents  to  the  transfer  of  the  Veto  Share  to  any successor Agent appointed pursuant to the terms of this Clause 26.13 and shall ensure that any such transfer of the Veto Share is promptly recorded, and the successor Agent duly registered as the shareholder of the Veto Share, in the Borrower's register of members in accordance with the Borrower's articles of association.    Pending  registration  of  the  transfer,  the  retiring  Agent  shall exercise any right it may have, by virtue of continuing to be registered as the shareholder of the Veto Share, to cast a vote in relation to the Borrower, in accordance with the instructions of the successor Agent.  The Borrower shall, within three  Business Days of demand, reimburse the retiring  Agent for the amount of all costs and expenses (including legal fees) properly incurred by it in  making  available  such  documents  and  records,  providing  such  assistance and transfer of the Veto Share.
(f) The Agent's resignation notice shall only take effect upon the appointment of a successor and the transfer of the Veto Share to such successor.

Upon the appointment of a successor, the retiring Agent shall be discharged from any further obligation in respect of the Finance Documents (other than its obligations under paragraph (e) above) but shall remain entitled to the benefit of Clause 14.3 (Indemnity to the Agent) and this Clause 26 (and any agency fees for the account of the retiring Agent shall cease to accrue from (and shall be payable on) that date).  Any successor and each of the other Parties shall have the same rights and obligations amongst themselves as they would have had if such successor had been an original Party.
After consultation with the Borrower, the Majority Lenders may, by notice to the Agent, require it to resign in accordance with paragraph (b) above.  In this event, the Agent shall resign in accordance with paragraph (b) above.
The foregoing provisions shall apply  with equal effect, mutatis mutandis, to the Calculation Agent as if each reference in paragraph (a) to (h) above to the Agent was to the Calculation Agent.
The  Agent  shall  resign  in  accordance  with  paragraph (b)  above  (and,  to  the extent  applicable,  shall  use  reasonable  endeavours  to  appoint  a  successor Agent pursuant to paragraph (c) above) if on or after the date which is three months before the earliest FATCA Application Date relating to any payment to the Agent under the Finance Documents, either:
(i) (ii) the  Agent  fails  to  respond  to  a  request  under  Clause  12.8  (FATCA Information) and the Borrower or a Lender reasonably believes that the Agent will not be (or will have ceased to be) a FATCA Exempt Party on or after that FATCA Application Date;
the information supplied by the Agent pursuant to Clause 12.8 (FATCA Information) indicates that the Agent will not be (or will have ceased to  be)  a  FATCA  Exempt  Party  on  or  after  that  FATCA  Application Date; or
(iii) the Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the Agent will not be (or will have ceased to be) a FATCA Exempt Party on or after that FATCA Application Date;
and (in each case) the Borrower or a Lender reasonably believes that a Party will be required to make a FATCA Deduction that would not be required if the Agent  were  a  FATCA  Exempt  Party,  and  the  Borrower  or  that  Lender,  by notice to the Agent, requires it to resign.
26.14  Replacement of the Agent
(a) After consultation with the Borrower, the Majority Lenders may, by giving 30 days notice to the Agent (or at any time the Agent is an Impaired Agent, by giving  any  shorter  notice  determined  by  the  Majority  Lenders),  replace  the Agent by appointing a successor Agent.
(b) The  retiring  Agent  shall  (at  its  own  cost  if  it  is  an  Impaired  Agent  and otherwise  at  the  expense  of  the  Lenders)  make  available  to  the  successor

The Borrower shall, within three  Business Days of demand, reimburse the retiring  Agent for the amount of all costs and expenses (including legal fees) properly incurred by it in  making  available  such  documents  and  records,  providing  such  assistance and transfer of the Veto Share.
(f) The Agent's resignation notice shall only take effect upon the appointment of a successor and the transfer of the Veto Share to such successor.

(a) (b) On each date on which an Obligor or a Lender is required to make a payment under a Finance Document, that Obligor or that Lender shall make the same available  to  the  Agent  (unless  a  contrary  indication  appears  in  a  Finance Document) for value on the due date at the time and in such funds specified by the Agent as being customary at the time for settlement of transactions in the relevant currency in the place of payment.
Payment shall be made to such account in the principal financial centre of the country of that currency (or, in relation to euro, in a principal financial centre in such Participating Member State or London, as specified by the Agent) with such bank as the Agent specifies.
30.2  Distributions by the Agent
Each payment received by the Agent under the Finance Documents for another Party shall,  subject  to  Clause 30.3  (Distributions  to  an  Obligor),  Clause 30.4  (Clawback) and Clause 26.19 (Deduction from amounts payable by the Agent) be made available by  the  Agent  as  soon  as  practicable  after  receipt  to  the  Party  entitled  to  receive payment in accordance with this Agreement (in the case of a Lender, for the account of its Facility Office), to such account as that Party may notify to the Agent by not less than five Business Days' notice with a bank in the principal financial centre of the country of that currency (or, in relation to euro, in a principal financial centre in such Participating Member State or London, as specified by that Party).
30.3  Distributions to an Obligor
The Agent may (with the consent of the Obligor or in accordance with Clause 31 (Set- off)) apply any amount received by it for that Obligor in or towards payment (on the date and in the currency and funds of receipt) of any amount due from that Obligor under  the  Finance  Documents  or  in  or  towards  purchase  of  any  amount  of  any currency to be so applied.
