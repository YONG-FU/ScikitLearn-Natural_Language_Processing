(b)  Neither the Company  nor any  Subsidiary  is  a  party to,  or otherwise subject to  any provision  contained  in,  any  instrument  evidencing  Indebtedness  of  the  Company  or  such Subsidiary, any agreement relating thereto or any other agreement (including,  but not limited to, its  charter or other organizational document)  which  limits  the amount of,  or otherwise imposes restrictions on the incurring of, Indebtedness of the Company, except (x) as specifically indicated in  Schedule 5.15  and  (y)  other instruments evidencing Indebtedness  in  an  aggregate amount not exceeding $10,000,000.

Re:
Basin  Electric Power Cooperative $50,000,000 First Mortgage Obligations,  2008  Series  B Notes due June  11,  2029;
Ladies  and  Gentlemen:
I am  General Counsel of Basin  Electric Power Cooperative,  a North Dakota electric cooperative corporation (the Cooperative) and in  that capacity,  render this opinion to you  in connection with the proposed offering  and sale to you  of the Cooperative's $50,000,000 First Mortgage Obligations, 2008 Series B Notes  due June  11,  2029 (the 2008 Series 8  Notes) under the Indenture between the Cooperative and U.S.  Bank National Association,  as trustee,  dated as  of January 1,  1998, as supplemented (the Indenture) through the  Eighteenth  Supplemental Indenture dated as of February 15, 2008 (the Eighteenth Supplemental Indenture.  This opinion is  being delivered to you  pursuant to  Section 4.4(a)(ii) of the  2008 Series  B Note Purchase Agreement dated as of March  12,  2008 (the  Note Purchase Agreement) between you  and the  Cooperative. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall  have the  meanings set forth  in the Note Purchase Agreement.
I am  familiar with  the  affairs and  properties of the Cooperative and have reviewed such
documents,  instruments,  records  and files  relating to the 2008 Series B Notes,  the  Indenture, the Eighteenth Supplemental Indenture, the  Note Purchase Agreement and  Offering  Materials as  I have deemed necessary in  order to render the opinions set forth  below.  Based upon the foregoing,  I am of the  opinion that:
(i) The Cooperative has  been  duly incorporated and is validly existing  as an  electric
cooperative corporation in  good standing under the  laws of the State of North Dakota,  with  power and  authority (corporate and other) to  own  its  properties and conduct its business as described in the Offering  Materials;
(ii) Each subsidiary of the Cooperative has been duly incorporated and  is validly existing as
a corporation in  good standing under the laws  of its jurisdiction of incorporation;  and all  of the issued shares of capital stock of each such  subsidiary have been duly and validly authorized and issued,  are fully paid  and non assessable, and are owned directly by the Cooperative, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, equities or claims;
(iii) The Cooperative and each of its  subsidiaries has been duly qualified as  a foreign
corporation for the transaction of business and is in good standing  under the laws of each jurisdiction in  which it owns  or leases properties or conducts any business so as to require such qualification;

(iv) The Cooperative and each of its subsidiaries has good and marketable title to all  real
property and  marketable title to all personal property owned by them,  in  each case free  and clear of all  liens,  encumbrances and defects except such as  are described in  the Offering Materials or such as do not materially affect the value of such property and do not interfere with the use made and proposed to be made of such property by the Cooperative and its subsidiaries;  and  any real property and  buildings held under lease by the Cooperative and its subsidiaries are held by them under valid,  subsisting and enforceable leases with  such exceptions as are not material and do not interfere with the use made and  proposed to  be  made of such property and  buildings by the Cooperative and its subsidiaries;
(v) To the best of my knowledge and other than as  set forth  in the Offering  Materials, there
are no legal or governmental inquiries,  investigations,  actions,  suits or proceedings pending  to which the Cooperative or any of its  subsidiaries is  a party or of which  any property of the Cooperative or any of its subsidiaries is  the subject which,  if determined adversely to  the Cooperative or any of its subsidiaries,  would  individually or in  the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the current or future financial position,  patronage capital,  margins or results  of operations of the Cooperative or any of its subsidiaries or the ability of the Cooperative to  perform its obligations under any Financing Agreement or on  the legality,  validity or enforceability of the Cooperative's obligations under any Financing Agreement;  and,  to the best of my knowledge,  no such inquiries,  investigations,  actions,  suits or proceedings are threatened or contemplated by governmental authorities or threatened by others.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  the  potential liabilities in  slides 70 through 78  in the power point presentation described in  Schedule 5.3 to the Note Purchase Agreement if determined adversely,  could have a material adverse effect on the financial position,  patronage capital,  margins,  results  of operation and properties of the Cooperative but would not impact the ability of the  Cooperative to perform its obligations under the Financing Agreements or affect the validity or enforceability of the  Financing Agreements~

Cooperative and constitutes a legal, valid  and binding  agreement of the Cooperative,  enforceable against the  Cooperative in  accordance with  its terms,  subject,  as  to enforcement, to bankruptcy, insolvency,  reorganization  and  other laws of general applicability relating  to  or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles;
(vii) The 2008 Series  B Notes have been duly authorized,  executed and authenticated in
accordance with  the terms of the  Indenture and when  delivered and paid for by you  in  accordance with the terms of the  Note Purchase Agreement will  have been validly issued and delivered and will constitute legal,  valid and binding obligations of the  Cooperative and enforceable in  accordance with their terms entitled, equally and ratably with all other obligations issued and to  be issued under the Indenture, to the benefits of the  lien  and security provided by the Indenture, subject.  as to enforcement,  to bankruptcy,  insolvency,  reorganization and other laws of general applicability relating to  or affecting creditors'  rights  and to general equity principles. All conditions precedent provided for in the  Indenture relating to the authentication and delivery of such 2008 Series  8  Notes have been complied with  and all  documents and cash  and/or 2008 Series B Notes which have been or are delivered to the Trustee conform to the requirements of the Indenture;
(viii) Each of the Indenture (excluding  the  Eighteenth Supplemental Indenture) and the Eighteenth Supplemental Indenture has been duly authorized,  executed and delivered by the parties thereto and constitutes a legal,  valid and binding instrument, enforceable in  accordance with its terms,  subject,  as to enforcement, to bankruptcy,  insolvency,  reorganization and other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles;

with all  of the provisions of the 2008 Series 8  Notes, the Indenture and the Note Purchase Agreement and the consummation of the transactions therein contemplated will not conflict with or result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of,  or constitute a default under,  any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust,  loan agreement or other agreement or instrument to which the Cooperative or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which the Cooperative or any of its subsidiaries is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the Cooperative or any of its subsidiaries is  subject,  nor will such actions result in  any violation of the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Cooperative or any statute or any order,  rule or regulation  of any court or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Cooperative or any of its subsidiaries or any of their properties;

or with any governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Cooperative or any of its subsidiaries or any of their property is required for the issue and sale of the 2008 Series B Notes or in connection with the consummation by the  Cooperative of the transactions contemplated by the Note Purchase Agreement or the  Indenture;
(xi) Each of the Wholesale Power Contracts between the Cooperative and each of its
members is the valid  and  binding  obligation  of the Cooperative enforceable against the Cooperative in  accordance with  its terms,  subject as  to enforcement to bankruptcy,  insolvency,  fraudulent transfer and other similar laws affecting creditors' rights  generally and  to general equity principles;
(xii) Each of the  Cooperative and its  subsidiaries owns,  possesses or has obtained all
licenses,  permits,  certificates,  consents,  orders,  approvals and other authorizations (collectively, "Authorizations") from,  and  has made all declarations and filings with,  all federal,  state,  local and other governmental authorities (including foreign regulatory agencies),  all  self-regulatory organizations and all courts and  other tribunals,  domestic or foreign,  necessary to own  or lease, as the case may be,  and to  operate its properties and to carry on its business as  conducted as  of the date hereof, or where the failure to own, possess or obtain such Authorizations or make such declarations and filings could not reasonably be  expected to have a material adverse effect on  the Cooperative and its subsidiaries;  and neither the Cooperative nor any such subsidiary has received any actual notice of any proceeding relating to  revocation or modification of any such Authorization, except where the revocation or modification of such Authorization could not reasonably be expected to  have a material adverse effect on the Cooperative and its subsidiaries;  and each of the Cooperative and its subsidiaries is  in  compliance with all  laws  and regulations  relating to the conduct of its  business as  conducted  as  of the date hereof,  except where such  noncompliance could not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on  the Cooperative and  its subsidiaries;
(xiii)  None of the Trust Estate (as defined in  the Indenture) is  subject to  any Prior Lien  (as
defined in  the Indenture) other than  Prior Liens  permitted by Section  13.6 of the Indenture; the descriptions of all  such properties  and assets contained in  the granting clauses of the Indenture are correct and adequate for the purposes of the Indenture;  and all taxes and recording  and filing fees required to  be paid with  respect to the execution, recording  or filing  of the Indenture, the filing  of financing  statements related thereto and similar documents and the issuance of the 2008 Series B Notes have been paid;  and
nd the Eighteenth Supplemental Indenture has been duly authorized,  executed and delivered by the parties thereto and constitutes a legal,  valid and binding instrument, enforceable in  accordance with its terms,  subject,  as to enforcement, to bankruptcy,  insolvency,  reorganization and other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles;

(xiv) (a) The execution and delivery of the  Indenture and the supplements thereto creates a
valid security interest in  the Trust Estate (as defined in the Indenture),  as  security for the Obligations.  The Indenture (including any  necessary related financing  statements) has been filed and recorded wherever and to the extent necessary to perfect the lien thereof upon the real property and personal property now owned by the Cooperative in  the  States of Colorado,  Iowa, Montana,  Nebraska,  North Dakota,  South  Dakota and Wyoming and intended to be  subject thereto; all  fees  or taxes  in  connection therewith have been  paid  and  no other filing  or recordation  is presently necessary in  order to perfect the  lien of the  Indenture on  the Trust Estate (as defined in the Indenture);  and (b) to the extent a security interest may be perfected by filing,  the security interest in  the Trust Estate is  perfected and the Indenture now constitutes a legally valid  and directly enforceable lien  on  personal property and first mortgage lien  (except as  may be  limited by (i) the laws of the jurisdictions in which the physical properties covered thereby are located affecting the remedies for the enforcement of the security provided therein  (which  laws do not,  in  the opinion of the undersigned,  make inadequate the remedies necessary for the realization  of the benefits of such security)  and (ii) applicable bankruptcy,  reorganization or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally) for the equal and proportionate security of the 2008 Series 8  Notes and of the mortgage bonds of other series heretofore issued and hereafter to be  issued under the Indenture,  upon the personal property and  mortgaged properties specifically described therein as  subject to the lien thereof (excluding all properties heretofore disposed of in  accordance with the terms of the Indenture or expressly excepted therefrom and real  property subsequently acquired by the Cooperative) and such personal property and mortgaged properties,  other than said  excluded and excepted properties,  comprise and constitute substantially all  of the utility property of the Cooperative in  the States of Colorado,  Iowa,  Montana,  Nebraska,  North Dakota,  South  Dakota and Wyoming.
With the exception of paragraphs (iv),  (xiii)  and  (xiv)  hereof,  the foregoing  opinions are
limited to the laws of the State of North Dakota (other than corporate good standing  and foreign qualification and state securities or blue sky laws)  and the  laws of the United States  of America and I express no opinion with  respect to the  laws  of any other jurisdiction.  With respect to the opinion set forth  in paragraphs (iv),  (xiii)  and  (xiv)  hereof,  the opinions are based upon and limited to the application of the  laws  of Colorado,  Iowa,  Montana,  Nebraska,  North  Dakota,  South Dakota and Wyoming and the applicable laws of the United States of America and in giving the opinions set forth  in  paragraphs (iv),  (xiii)  and (xiv)  hereof,  I have relied  on the opinions of counsel licensed to practice law in the states of Colorado,  Iowa,  Montana,  Nebraska,  North Dakota,  South Dakota and Wyoming, each of whom  I believe to be  reliable.
In  providing the foregoing opinion,  I express no  opinion  as  to (i)  the enforceability of any
provision of the Indenture which purports to waive the right of benefit from  the doctrine of marshalling of assets upon foreclosure,  (ii) the validity or enforceability of any covenant to pay interest on defaulted interest, and (iii) the effectiveness of any provision in  the  Indenture purporting to create a "springing lien" whereby certain property initially excepted from  the lien of the  Indenture would become subject to the lien of the Indenture upon the occurrence of an  Event of Default (as defined in  the  Indenture) thereunder;  and moreover,  that the  Indenture contains customary provisions for the enforcement of the security provided for therein,  certain of which  may be limited by the laws of the State of North Dakota (but such laws do  not,  in  my opinion,  make inadequate the remedies necessary for the realization of the benefits of such security).
