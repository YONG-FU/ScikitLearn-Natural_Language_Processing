"(b) Each of the Notes shall bear interest on an amount equal to the Percentage of such  Note  multiplied  by  the  Outstanding  Principal  and  represented  thereby  as  set  forth  in Section 2.03.  Each Note Purchaser is hereby authorized by the Issuer, but not obligated, to enter the amount of its Notes, including, without limitation, interest capitalized pursuant to Section 2.03, and the amount of each payment or prepayment of principal or interest thereon in the appropriate spaces on the reverse of or on an attachment to such Notes or in other records maintained by each Note Purchaser and, absent manifest error, such records shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations of the Issuer in respect of the Notes, interest and fees due or accrued thereunder; provided, however, that the failure of any Note Purchaser to set forth such amounts, principal payments or other information shall not in any manner affect the obligations of the Issuer to repay the Notes or any other amounts due hereunder or any other Note Document."
