"(a) Advances. Each Lender severally agrees, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, to make Advances to the Borrower on the Effective Date in an amount for each Lender not to exceed such Lenders Commitment, which Advances shall be funded net of the OID Amount. For the avoidance of doubt, the maximum aggregate commitment of the Lenders to make Advances on the Effective Date under this Agreement shall be $174,600,000.00, and the maximum aggregate principal amount to be repaid by the Borrower in respect thereof is $180,000,000.00, together with accrued interest thereon. Once borrowed, the Borrower may not reborrow any Advances that have been repaid or prepaid, whether in whole or in part. Each Lenders initial Commitment shall terminate immediately and without further action on the Commitment Termination Date."
