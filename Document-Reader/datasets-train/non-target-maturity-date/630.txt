Anything  contained  herein  to  the  contrary  notwithstanding,  the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder at any time shall be limited to an aggregate amount equal to  the  largest  amount  that  would  not  render  its obligations hereunder  subject to  avoidance  as  a fraudulent transfer or conveyance under Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provisions of any similar federal or state law."
