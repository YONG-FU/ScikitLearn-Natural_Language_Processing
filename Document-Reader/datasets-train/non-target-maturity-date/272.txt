"Subject to this Clause  11, a Co-Borrower may select an Interest Period of one (1), two (2) or three (3) Months or any other period agreed between the Parent and  the  Agent  (acting  on  the  instructions  of  all  Lenders)  in  relation  to  the relevant Loan.  In addition, in relation to each Facility, a Co-Borrower may select an Interest Period of less than one (1) Month if necessary to ensure there are Loans (with an aggregate amount equal to or greater than the Repayment Instalment) under the relevant Facility which have an Interest Period ending on a Repayment Date relating to that relevant Facility for such Co-Borrower to make the Repayment Instalment due on that date."
