"(d) Each  Guarantor  agrees  that  it  will  not  be  entitled  to  any  right  of  subrogation  in relation  to  the  Holders in  respect  of  any  obligations  guaranteed  hereby  until  payment  in  full  of  all obligations guaranteed hereby.  Each Guarantor further agrees that, as between the Guarantors, on the one  hand,  and  the  Holders  and  the  Trustee,  on  the  other  hand,  (1)  the  maturity  of  the  obligations guaranteed  hereby  may  be  accelerated  as  provided  in  Article  6  hereof  for  the  purposes  of  this Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby, and (2) in the event of any declaration of acceleration of such obligations as provided in Article 6 hereof, such obligations (whether or not due and payable) will  forthwith  become  due  and  payable  by  the  Guarantors  for  the  purpose  of  this  Guarantee.    The Guarantors  will  have  the  right  to  seek  contribution  from  any  non-paying  Guarantor  so  long  as  the exercise of such right does not impair the rights of the Holders under the Guarantee."
