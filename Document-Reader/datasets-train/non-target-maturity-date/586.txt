"12.13, it shall be sufficient for such party to certify that it would have suffered a loss had the actual purchase of Sterling been made with the amount so received in that other currency on the date of receipt or recovery (or, if a purchase of Sterling on that date had not been possible, on  the  first  date  on  which  it  would  have  been  possible).  These  indemnities,  to  the  extent permitted by law: (a) constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuers and the Guarantors other obligations; (b) give rise to a separate and independent cause of action; (c) apply irrespective of any waiver  granted by  the Security  Agent or the Trustee; and  (d) shall continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under this Indenture, any Note or Guarantee or any other judgment or order."
