"(a) If an Obligor or a Security Grantor fails to pay any amount payable by it under a Finance Document on its due date, interest shall accrue on the overdue amount from  the  due  date  up  to  the  date  of  actual  payment  (both  before  and  after judgment)  at  a  rate  which,  subject to  paragraph (b)  below,  is  1.0  per  cent.  per annum  higher  than  the  rate  which  would  have  been  payable  if  the  overdue amount  had,  during  the  period  of  non-payment,  constituted  a  Bond  in  the currency  of  the  overdue  amount  for  successive  Interest  Periods,  each  of  a duration selected by the Bondholders  Representative (acting reasonably).  Any interest  accruing  under  this  Clause  14.3  shall  be  immediately  payable  by  the Obligor  or  Security  Grantor  (as  the  case  may  be)  on  demand  by  the Bondholders Representative."
