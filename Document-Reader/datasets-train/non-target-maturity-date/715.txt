"Make-Whole Premium means, with respect to any applicable repayment of the Outstanding Principal of the Notes, the excess, if any, of (A) the present value (calculated using an annual discount factor equal to the applicable Treasury Rate plus 50 basis points) of the remaining payments of cash interest that would have been due and/or accrued prior to the applicable Make- Whole Expiry Date on the Notes being repaid on such repayment date, in each case, excluding all accrued and unpaid interest on such Notes being repaid, over (B) the Outstanding Principal of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest being repaid as of such repayment date; provided, however, that in no case shall the Make-Whole Premium be less than zero.  For purposes of this calculation, such interest payment or accrued interest shall be projected by using the interest rate then in effect (including,  to  the  extent  applicable,  under  the  provisions  of  Section 2.03(c))  from  the  date  of prepayment or repayment through the applicable Make-Whole Expiry Date."
