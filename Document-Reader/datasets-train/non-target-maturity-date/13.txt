"All payments applied to principal or interest on any Note shall be applied first to any interest then due and payable, then to principal then due and payable, and last to any prepayment of principal and interest.  All distributions  of  amounts  described  in  any  of  subsections (ii),  (iii)  or  (iv)  above  shall  be  made  by Administrative  Agent  pro  rata  to  each  Holder  Party  then  owed  Note  Obligations  described  in  such subsection in proportion to all amounts owed to all Holder Parties which are described in such subsection; provided  that  if  any  Holder  then  owes  payments  to  Administrative  Agent  under  Section 11.4,  any amounts  otherwise  distributable  under  this  section  to  such  Holder  shall  be  deemed  to  belong  to Administrative Agent to the extent of such unpaid payments, and Administrative Agent shall apply such amounts to make such unpaid payments rather than distribute such amounts to such Holder."
