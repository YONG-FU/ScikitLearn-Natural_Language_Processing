"(b)  A Permitted Amendment shall be effected pursuant to a Loan Modification Agreement executed and delivered by Holdings, the Borrower, each Accepting Lender and the Administrative Agent; provided that no Permitted Amendment shall become effective unless (i) no Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the date of effectiveness thereof, (ii) on the date of effectiveness thereof, the representations and warranties of each Loan Party set forth in the Loan Documents shall be true and correct in all material respects, in each case on and as of such date, except in the case of any such representation and warranty that specifically relates to an earlier date, in which case such representation and warranty shall be so true and correct in all material respects on and as of such earlier date, (iii) Holdings and the Borrower shall have delivered, or agreed to deliver by a date following the effectiveness of such Permitted Amendment reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, to the Administrative Agent such legal opinions, board resolutions, secretarys certificates, officers certificates and other documents (including reaffirmation agreements, supplements and/or amendments to Mortgages or other Security Documents, in each case to the extent applicable) as shall reasonably be requested by the Administrative Agent in connection therewith and (iv) any applicable Minimum Extension Condition shall be satisfied (unless waived by the Borrower).  The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender as to the effectiveness of each Loan Modification Agreement.  Each Loan Modification Agreement may, without the consent of any Lender other than the applicable Accepting Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent, to give effect to the provisions of this Section, including any amendments necessary to treat the applicable Loans and/or Commitments of the Accepting Lenders as a new class of loans and/or commitments hereunder (and the Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent to enter into any such amendments); provided that all Borrowings, all prepayments of Loans and all reductions of Commitments shall continue to be made on a ratable basis among all Lenders, based on the relative amounts of their Commitments (i.e., both extended and non-extended), until the repayment of the non- extended Loans on the relevant Maturity Date and/or termination of the non-extended Commitments.  The Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereby acknowledge that the minimum borrowing, pro rata borrowing and pro rata payment requirements contained elsewhere in this Agreement are not intended to apply to the transactions effected pursuant to this Section 2.17.  This Section 2.17 shall supersede any provisions in Section 2.15 or Section 9.02 to the contrary."
