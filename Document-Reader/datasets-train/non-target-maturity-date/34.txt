The amount of Disqualified Capital Stock deemed to be outstanding at any time for purposes of this Agreement  will  be  the  maximum  amount  that  the  Loan  Parties  may  become  obligated  to  pay upon the maturity of, or pursuant to any mandatory redemption provisions of, such Disqualified Capital Stock, exclusive of accrued dividends."
