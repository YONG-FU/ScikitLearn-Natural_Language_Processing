"In event of prepayment after the closed period (2nd or 3rd loan years), a prepayment fee will be payable equal to the greater of 1% of the then outstanding principal indebtedness, or Yield Maintenance.  Yield Maintenance is defined as the exces of the present value on the date of prepayment of all remaining Monthly Payments and the outstanding principal of the loan and interest due on the Maturity date discounted at the yeild maintenance rate over the amount of principal of the loan being prepaid.  Yield Maintenance rate is the interest rate which, when compounded monthly, is the equivalent to the Treasury Yield plus 50 basis points.  If the loan is prepaid during the 4th year the prepayment fee shall be equal to 1% of the then-outstanding principal indebtedness."
