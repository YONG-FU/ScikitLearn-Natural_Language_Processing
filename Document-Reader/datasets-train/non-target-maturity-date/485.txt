"(c) Auto-Renewal Letters of Credit.  If an LC Obligor so requests in any applicable LC Request, each LC Issuer shall agree to issue a Letter of Credit that has automatic renewal provisions; provided, however, that any Letter of Credit that has automatic renewal provisions must permit such LC Issuer to prevent any such renewal at least once in each twelve-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof not later than a day in each such twelve-month period to be agreed upon at the time such Letter of Credit is issued.  Once any such Letter of Credit that has automatic renewal provisions has been issued, the Lenders shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) such LC Issuer to permit the renewal of such Letter of Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Revolving Facility Termination Date applicable to each Class of Revolving Commitments; provided, however, that such LC Issuer shall not permit any such renewal if (i) such LC Issuer has determined that it would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of Credit in its renewed form under the terms hereof, or (ii) it has received notice (which may be by email or in writing) on or before the day that is two (2) Business Days before the date that such LC Issuer is permitted to send a notice of non-renewal from the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Parent Borrower that one or more of the applicable conditions specified in Section 4.02 is not then satisfied."
