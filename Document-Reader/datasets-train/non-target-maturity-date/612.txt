"In  the case of each optional  prepayment of  Notes  pursuant to  this Section 8, the principal  amount  of  each  Note  to  be  prepaid  shall  mature  and  become  due  and  payable  on  the date fixed for such prepayment, together with interest on such principal amount accrued to such date  and  the  applicable  Make-Whole  Amount,  if  any.    From  and  after  such  date,  unless  the Company  shall  fail  to  pay  such  principal  amount  when  so  due  and  payable,  together  with  the interest  and  Make-Whole  Amount,  if  any,  as  aforesaid,  interest  on  such  principal  amount  shall cease  to  accrue.    Any  Note  paid  or  prepaid  in  full  shall  be  surrendered  to  the  Company  and cancelled and shall not be reissued, and no Note shall be issued in lieu of any prepaid principal amount of any Note."
