"(i) Revolving  Credit  Commitments.  The  Total  Revolving  Credit Commitment shall  terminate on the Final  Maturity Date.  The Borrowers  may,  after the  second anniversary of the Effective Date, reduce the Total Revolving Credit Commitment to an amount (which may be zero) not less than the greater of (x) the sum of (A) the aggregate unpaid principal amount  of  all  Revolving  Loans  then  outstanding,  (B) the  aggregate  principal  amount  of  all Revolving  Loans  not  yet  made  as  to  which  a  Notice  of  Borrowing  has  been  given  by  the Administrative Borrower under Section 2.02,  (C) the Letter of Credit Obligations  at  such  time, and  (D)  the stated  amount of all  Letters of Credit not yet  issued as  to  which a request has  been made and not withdrawn and (y) $10,000,000, unless the Total Revolving Credit Commitment is reduced  to  zero  in  connection  with  the  termination  of  this  Agreement  pursuant  to  Section 2.05(b)(iii).  Each  such  reduction  shall  be  (1)  in  an  amount  which  is  an  integral  multiple  of $1,000,000  (or  by  the  full  amount  of  the  Total  Revolving  Credit  Commitment  in  effect immediately  prior  to  such  reduction  if such  amount  at  that  time  is  less  than  $1,000,000),  (2) made  by  providing  not  less  than  5  Business  Days'  prior  written  notice  to  the  Administrative Agent,  and  (3)  irrevocable  (except  if  such  notice  states  that  it  is  conditioned  upon  the effectiveness  of other credit facilities  or the  receipt  of the  proceeds  from  the  issuance of other Indebtedness, in which case such notice of prepayment may be revoked by the Borrowers if such condition is  not  satisfied).  Once reduced,  the Total Revolving  Credit Commitment may not be increased.  Each  such  reduction  of the  Total  Revolving  Credit  Commitment  shall  reduce  the Revolving  Credit  Commitment  of each Lender proportionately in  accordance with  its  Pro  Rata Share thereof."
