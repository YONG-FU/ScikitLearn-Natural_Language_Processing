"Upon  any  Notes  becoming  due  and  payable  under  this  Section 12.1,  whether automatically or by declaration, such Notes will forthwith mature and the entire unpaid principal amount  of  such  Notes,  plus  (x)  all  accrued  and  unpaid  interest  thereon  (including,  without limitation,  interest  accrued  thereon  at  the  Default  Rate)  and  (y)  the  Make-Whole  Amount determined in respect of such principal amount (to the full extent permitted by applicable law), shall all be immediately due and payable, in each and every case without presentment, demand, protest or further notice, all of which are hereby waived.  The Company acknowledges, and the parties  hereto  agree,  that  each  Noteholder  has  the  right  to  maintain  its  investment  in  the  Notes free  from  repayment  by  the  Company  (except  as  herein  specifically  provided  for)  and  that  the provision for payment of a Make-Whole Amount by the Company in the event that the Notes are prepaid or are accelerated as a result of an Event of Default, is intended to provide compensation for the deprivation of such right under such circumstances."
