"20.17  Usury  Savings  Clause.    Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  herein,  the  aggregate interest rate charged with respect to any of the Obligations, including all charges or fees in connection therewith deemed in the nature of interest under applicable law shall not exceed the highest rate permitted by applicable Government Rule (the Highest Lawful Rate).  If the rate of interest (determined without regard to the preceding sentence) under this Agreement at any time exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate, the outstanding amount of the Notes hereunder shall bear interest at the Highest Lawful Rate until the total amount of interest due hereunder equals the amount of interest which would have been due hereunder if the stated rates of interest set forth in this Agreement had at all times been in effect.  In addition, if when the  Notes  issued  hereunder  are  repaid  in  full  the  total  interest  due  hereunder  (taking  into  account  the increase  provided  for  above)  is  less  than  the  total  amount  of  interest  which  would  have  been  due hereunder if the stated rates of interest set forth in this Agreement had at all times been in effect, then to the  extent  permitted  by  law,  Investments  shall  pay  to  the  Notes  Purchasers  an  amount  equal  to  the difference between the amount of interest paid and the amount of interest which would have been paid if the Highest Lawful Rate had at all times been in effect.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is the intention of the Notes Purchasers and Investments to conform strictly to any applicable usury laws.  Accordingly, if any  Notes  Purchaser  contracts  for,  charges,  or  receives  any  consideration  which  constitutes  interest  in excess  of  the  Highest  Lawful  Rate,  then  any  such  excess  shall  be  cancelled  automatically  and,  if previously paid, shall at such Notes Purchasers option be applied to the outstanding amount of the Notes issued hereunder or be refunded to Investments."
