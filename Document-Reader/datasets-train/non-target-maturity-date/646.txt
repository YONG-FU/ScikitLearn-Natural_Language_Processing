"The Note may be prepaid, in whole or in part, upon at least thirty (30) days prior written notice to Lender and upon payment of all accrued interest (and other Obligations then due under the Documents) and a prepayment premium equal to the greater of (a) one percent (1%) of the principal amount being prepaid multiplied by the quotient of the number of full months remaining until the Maturity Date, calculated as of the date on which the prepayment will be made (the Prepayment Date), divided by the number of full months comprising the term of the Note, or (b) the Present Value of the Loan (defined below) less the amount of principal and accrued interest (if any) being prepaid, calculated as of the Prepayment Date. The Prepayment Premium shall be due and payable, except as provided in this Agreement or as limited by law, upon any prepayment of the Note, whether voluntary or involuntary, and Lender shall not be obligated to accept any prepayment of the Note unless it is accompanied by the Prepayment Premium."
