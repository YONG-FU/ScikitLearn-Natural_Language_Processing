"Make-Whole Amount means, with respect to any (a) prepayment of the Loans pursuant to any subsection of Section 2.8 which requires payment of the Make-Whole Amount, or  (b)  acceleration  of  the  Loans  pursuant  to  Section  6.2,  an  amount  equal  to  the  then  present value of the scheduled interest payments on the Loans remaining through the date which is the second anniversary of the Closing Date avoided by such prepayment or acceleration (including any interest due on the date of prepayment), with the amount of such interest payments avoided discounted in accordance with accepted financial practice at a rate that is equal to the sum of (i) fifty (50) basis points, plus (ii) the yield to maturity of actively traded United States Treasury securities having a maturity equal to the remaining life of the principal payments on the Loans avoided by such prepayment or acceleration, such yields to maturity to be determined in each case  by  interpolating  linearly  from  the  yield  to  maturity  of  actively  traded,  currently  quoted United States Treasury securities whose maturities are closest to and greater than such remaining life of the Loans to the scheduled Maturity Date, as such yields to maturity are quoted by the Knight-Ridder  Financial  Information  division  of  Knight-Ridder,  Inc.  (or,  if  unavailable,  such other  source  that  most  closely  corresponds  as  selected  by  the  Administrative  Agent)  at  12:00 p.m.  (noon)  (New  York  City  time)  on  the  date  of  such  prepayment  or  acceleration,  all  as determined by the Administrative Agent."
