"(f) Upon the declaration by the Administrative Agent that any or all outstanding Accommodations are immediately due and payable or the occurrence of the Maturity Date, an amount equal to each outstanding and undrawn Letter of Credit shall, without demand or notice to the Borrowers or any other member of the Borrower Group, be deemed to have been paid or disbursed by the Issuing Lender under such Letter of Credit (notwithstanding that such amount may not in fact have been so paid or disbursed), and the Borrowers shall be immediately obligated to reimburse the Issuing Lender for the amount deemed to have been so paid or disbursed in Cdn. Dollars by the Issuing Lender. Any amounts so received by the Issuing Lender to this Section 2.12(f) shall be paid to the Administrative Agent and held by it in an interest bearing account (such interest for the account of the Borrowers) as collateral security for the repayment of the Borrowers obligations in connection with the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Lender. If the Borrowers fail to reimburse the Issuing Lender for such deemed Disbursement, interest shall be payable on such amount by the Borrowers to the Issuing Lender at the rates then in effect under the Operating Credit for each such Loan."
