"(b) The  Borrower  and  each  Incremental  Lender  shall  execute  and  deliver  to  the Administrative Agent an  Incremental Assumption Agreement and such  other  documentation  as the Administrative  Agent shall reasonably specify  to  evidence  the  Incremental  Commitment  of such  Incremental  Lender.    Each  Incremental  Assumption  Agreement  shall  specify  the  terms  of the applicable Incremental Loans; provided, that (i) the Other Term Loans shall rank pari passu or  junior  in  right  of  payment  and/or  of  security  with  the  Initial  Loans  (and,  to  the  extent  such Other Term Loans are subordinated in right of payment and/or security, such Other Term Loans shall be subject to intercreditor arrangements the terms of which shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent) and, except as to pricing, amortization and final maturity date, shall have  (x) the  same  terms  as  the  Initial  Loans,  as  applicable,  or  (y)  such  other  terms  as  shall  be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, provided that if the Yield in respect of any Other Term Loans secured on a pari passu basis with the Initial Loans shall exceed the Yield in respect of the Initial  Loans by more than 0.50%, the Applicable Margin in respect of the Initial Loans (and any Incremental Loans having the same terms as the Initial Loans) shall be increased so that the Yield in respect of such Other Term Loans is not greater than 0.50% above the Yield in respect of the Initial Loans, (ii) the final maturity date of any Other Term Loans shall be no earlier than the Maturity Date, and (iii) the weighted average life to maturity of any Other Term Loans  shall  be  no  shorter  than  the  remaining  weighted  average  life  to  maturity  of  the  Initial Loans (together with any Incremental Loans having the same terms as the Initial Loans). Each of the  parties  hereto  hereby  agrees  that,  upon  the  effectiveness  of  any  Incremental  Assumption Agreement, this Agreement shall be amended to the extent (but only to the extent) necessary to reflect  the  existence  and  terms  of  the  Incremental  Commitments  evidenced  thereby.  Any  such deemed  amendment  may  be  memorialized  in  writing  by  the  Administrative  Agent  with  the Borrowers consent (not to be unreasonably withheld) and furnished to the other parties hereto."
