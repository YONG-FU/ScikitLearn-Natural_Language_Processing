"The Parent needs only perform its obligations under paragraph (c) above if it is not unlawful  for the relevant Group Company to become a Guarantor and that Group Company becoming a Guarantor would not result in personal liability for that Group Companys directors or other management.  Each Obligor must use, and  must  procure  that  the  relevant  person  uses,  all  reasonable  endeavours lawfully  available  to  avoid  any  such  unlawfulness  or  personal  liability.    This includes  agreeing  to  a  limit  on  the  amount  guaranteed.    The  Bondholders Representative  may (but shall  not be obliged to) agree to such a  limit  if,  in  its opinion (acting in good faith), to do so would avoid the relevant unlawfulness or personal liability. In particular, the obligations of each Guarantor incorporated in France (i) shall not include any obligation which if incurred would constitute a violation  to  its  corporate  interest  (intrt  social),  a  misuse  of  corporate  assets within  the  meaning  of  article  L.  241-3  or  L.  241-6  of  the  French  commercial code or the provision of financial assistance as defined by Article L.225-216 of the  French  Commercial  Code  for  the  subscription,  or  the  acquisition  or  the refinancing of the acquisition of its own shares, and (ii) shall be limited at any time to the aggregate of the amounts due by its direct and indirect Subsidiaries as Issuer  under  the  Finance  Documents  and,  in  respect  of  Issuers  which  are  not direct or indirect Subsidiaries of the relevant Guarantor, shall  be  limited to the outstanding  amount  of  any  intercompany  loan  (or  other  debt  instruments) financed by an Issuance and made available to it by the relevant Issuer, it being specified  for  the  avoidance  of  doubt  that  any  amount  paid  by  such  Guarantor under  the  guarantee  shall  reduce  pro  tanto  the  amount outstanding  under  such intercompany loans (or other debt instruments)."
