"Treasury Rate means the yield to maturity at a time of computation of United States Treasury  securities  with  a  constant  maturity  (as  compiled  and  published  in  the  most  recent Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (519) which has become publicly available at least two (2)  Business  Days  prior  to  the  prepayment  date (or,  if  such  Statistical  Release is  no  longer published, any publicly  available source similar market data)) most nearly equal to the period from the applicable prepayment date to the Final Maturity Date, provided, however, that if the period  from  the  applicable  prepayment  date to  the  Final  Maturity  Date  is  not  equal  to  the constant maturity of a United States Treasury security for which a weekly average yield is given, the Treasury Rate shall be obtained by linear interpolation (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth (1/12th) of a year) from the weekly average yields of United States Treasury securities for which such yields are given having maturities as close as possible to the Final Maturity Date, except that if the period from the applicable prepayment date to the Final Maturity Date is less than one (1) year, the weekly average yield on actually traded United States Treasury securities adjusted to a constant maturity of one (1) year shall be used."
