"(d) PIK Interest. Notwithstanding the requirements of Section 2.10(a) below or anything to the contrary in any Loan Document, all interest accruing at the Applicable PIK Margin with respect to any Advance shall be payable-in-kind rather than in cash (such interest, the PIK Interest) on each required date for payment of interest (other than the Maturity Date) referred to in clauses (a) and (b) above (each such date, an Interest Payment Date), and the amount of such PIK Interest shall be capitalized and added to the outstanding principal amount of such Advance on each such Interest Payment Date. From and after each applicable Interest Payment Date, the outstanding principal amount of the Advances shall without further action by any party hereto be deemed to be increased by the aggregate amount of PIK Interest so capitalized and added to such Advances in accordance with the provisions hereof, whereupon such amount of PIK Interest so capitalized and added shall also accrue interest in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.09."
