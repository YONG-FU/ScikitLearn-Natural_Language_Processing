"Section 11.1.  Appointment and Authority.  Each Holder hereby appoints Highbridge as Administrative Agent under the Note Documents.  Each Holder hereby irrevocably  authorizes Administrative  Agent,  and  Administrative  Agent  hereby  undertakes,  to  receive  payments  of Principal Amounts, interest and other amounts due hereunder as specified herein and to take all other  actions  and  to  exercise  such  powers  under  the  Note  Documents  as  are  specifically delegated to Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with all other powers reasonably incidental thereto.  With respect to any matters not expressly provided for in the Note Documents  and  any  matters  which  the  Note  Documents  place  within  the  discretion  of Administrative Agent, Administrative Agent shall not be required to exercise any discretion or take any action, and it may request instructions from Holders with respect to any such matter, in which case it shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected and free from liability to all Holder in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of Required Holders (including itself) (or such other number of percentage of the Holders as shall be  necessary  under  the  circumstances  as  provided  in  Section  12.1),  provided,  however,  that Administrative  Agent  shall  not  be  required  to  take  any  action  which  exposes  it  to  a  risk  of personal liability that it considers unreasonable or which is contrary to the Note Documents or to applicable Law.  Such appointment of Highbridge as Administrative Agent shall not, however, impair  or  modify  any  rights,  obligations  or  duties  which  Highbridge  or  any  Affiliate  of Highbridge otherwise has with respect to any Holder.  In its administration of this Agreement and  the  other  Note  Documents,  except  to  the  extent  to  which  another  standard  applies  to Highbridge  by  reason  of  any  other  document  between  Highbridge  and  another  Holder, Administrative  Agent  will  exercise  the  same  care  that  it  exercises  in  the  administration  or handling  of  transactions  for  its  own  account,  subject,  however,  to  Section  11.12  below.    The Administrative Agent may designate sub agents or other agents to assist with its role as agent hereunder  and  under  the  other  Note  Documents.    The  duties  undertaken  by  Highbridge,  as Administrative Agent, have been undertaken as an accommodation to Holders."
