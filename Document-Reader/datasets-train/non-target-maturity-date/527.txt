"(a) Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  in  this  Agreement,  subject  to  the  terms  of  this  Sec- tion 2.19, the Borrower may at any time and from time to time when no Event of Default then exists request that all or a portion of the Initial Term Loans, the Extended Term Loans or any Tranche of Incremental Term Loans (each, an Existing Initial Term Loan Tranche, Existing Extended Term Loan Tranche and Existing Incremental Term Loan Tranche, respectively), together with any related outstandings, be converted to extend the scheduled maturity date(s) of any payment of principal with respect to all or any portion of the principal amount (and related outstand- ings) of such Initial Term Loans, Extended Term Loans or Incremental Term Loans (any such Term Loans which have been so converted, Extended Initial Term Loans, Extended Existing Term Loans and Extended Incremen- tal Term Loans, respectively) and to provide for other terms consistent with this Section 2.19.  In order to establish any Extended Term Loans, the Borrower shall provide a notice to the Administrative Agent (who shall provide a copy of such notice to each of the Lenders under the applicable Existing Term Loan Tranche) (each, an Extension Request) setting forth the proposed terms of the Extended Term Loans to be established, which shall (x) be identi- cal as offered to each Lender under the relevant Existing Term Loan Tranche (including as to the proposed interest rates and fees payable) and (y) be identical to the Term Loans under the relevant Existing Term Loan Tranche from which such Extended Term Loans are to be converted, except that:  (i) all or any of the scheduled amortization pay- ments of principal of the Extended Term Loans may be delayed to later dates than the scheduled amortization pay- ments of principal of the Term Loans of such Existing Term Loan Tranche to the extent provided in the applicable Extension Amendment; (ii) the Effective Yield with respect to the Extended Term Loans (whether in the form of interest rate margin, upfront fees, original issue discount or otherwise) may be different than the Effective Yield for the Term Loans of such Existing Term Loan Tranche to the extent provided in the applicable Extension Amend- ment; (iii) the Extension Amendment may provide for other covenants and terms that apply solely to any period af- ter the Latest Maturity Date that is in effect on the effective date of the applicable Extension Amendment (immedi- ately prior to the establishment of  such Extended Term  Loans); (iv) Extended Term  Loans  may  have  mandatory prepayment terms which provide for the application of proceeds from mandatory prepayment events to be made first to prepay the Term Loans under the Existing Term Loan Tranche from which such Extended Term Loans have been converted before applying any such proceeds to prepay such Extending Term Loans; and (v) Extended Term Loans may have optional prepayment terms (including call protection and terms which allow Term Loans under the rele- vant Existing Term Loan Tranche from which such Extended Term Loans have been converted to be optionally pre- paid prior to the prepayment of such Extended Term Loans) as may be agreed by the Borrower and the Lenders thereof; provided that no Extended Term Loans may be optionally prepaid prior to the date on which all Term Loans with an earlier final stated maturity (including Term Loans under the Existing Term Loan Tranche from which such Term Loans were converted) are repaid in full, unless such optional prepayment is accompanied by a pro rata op- tional prepayment of such other Term Loans; provided, however, that (A) in no event shall the final maturity date of any Extended Term Loans of a given Extension Series at the time of establishment thereof be earlier than the then Latest Maturity Date of any other Term Loans hereunder and (B) the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of any Extended Term Loans of a given Extension Series at the time of establishment thereof shall be no shorter than the remaining Weighted Average Life to Maturity of any other Tranche of Term Loans then outstanding.  Any Extended Term Loans converted pursuant to any Extension Request shall be designated a series (each, an Extension Series) of Extended Term Loans, as applicable, for all purposes of this Agreement; provided that any Extended Term Loans converted from an Existing Term Loan Tranche may, to the extent provided in the applicable Extension Amend- ment,  be  designated  as  an  increase  in  any  previously  established  Extension  Series  with  respect  to  such  Existing Term Loan Tranche."
