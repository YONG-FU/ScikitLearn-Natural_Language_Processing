"Credit Commitments, as applicable and (vii) all borrowings under the applicable Revolving Commitments (i.e., the Existing Revolving Commitment Class and the Extended Revolving Credit Commitments of the applicable Extension Series) and repayments thereunder shall be made on a pro rata basis (except for (I) payments of interest and fees at different rates on Extended Revolving Credit Commitments (and related outstandings) and (II) repayments required upon the Maturity Date of the non-extending Revolving Commitments).  In connection with any such Extension, the Parent Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Term Loan Agent, with the approval of the Extending Lenders of the applicable Extension Series, may effect such amendments (including any Extension Amendment) to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and the Lenders hereby expressly authorize the Administrative Agent and the Term Loan Agent to enter into any such amendments, as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent, the Term Loan Agent and the Parent Borrower without the consent of any Lender except as expressly provided for in the immediately succeeding sentence, to implement the terms of any such Extension Notice, including any amendments necessary to establish new Classes, tranches or sub-tranches in respect of the Revolving Commitments or Term Loans so extended and such technical amendments as may be necessary or appropriate in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent, the Term Loan Agent and the Parent Borrower in connection with the establishment of such new tranches or sub-tranches (including to preserve the pro rata treatment of the extended and non-extended tranches and to provide for the reallocation of LC Outstandings, Swing Loans and Swing Loan Participations upon the expiration or termination of the commitments under any tranche or sub-tranche), in each case on terms not inconsistent with this Section 2.19. Any Extension of the Revolving Commitments shall require the consent of any LC Issuer and the Swing Line Lender to the extent that such Extension provides for issuance of Letters of Credit or the borrowing of Swing Loans by such LC Issuer at any time during such extended period.  Notwithstanding the conversion of any Existing Revolving Commitment Class (other than a commitment under an Incremental Initial Revolving Facility) into an Extended Revolving Credit Commitment, such Extended Revolving Credit Commitment shall be treated identically to the Existing Revolving Commitment Class of the applicable Extension Series for purposes of the obligations of a Revolving Lender in respect of Letters of Credit under Section 2.05, except that the applicable Extension Amendment may provide that the last day for issuing Letters of Credit may be extended and the related obligations to issue Letters of Credit may be continued (pursuant to mechanics to be specified in the applicable Extension Amendment) so long as the applicable LC Issuer has consented to such extensions (it being understood that no consent of any other Lender shall be required in connection with any such extension)."
