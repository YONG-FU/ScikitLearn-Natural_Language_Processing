"(a) If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in Section 6.01(a)(7)) occurs  and  is  continuing,  the  Trustee  by  notice  to  the  Issuer  or  the  Holders  of  at  least  30%  in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest, including Additional  Amounts, if any, will be due and  payable immediately. In the event of  a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in Section 6.01(a)(6) has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to Section 6.01(a)(6) shall have been remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration  of  acceleration  with  respect  thereto  and  if  (1)  the  annulment  of  the  acceleration  of  the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest, including Additional Amounts, if any, on the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived."
