"one or more occasions, by written notice to the Administrative Agent, make one or more offers (each, a Loan Modification Offer) to all (and not fewer than all) the Lenders to make one or more Permitted Amendments pursuant to procedures reasonably specified by the Administrative Agent and reasonably acceptable to the Borrower.  Such notice shall set forth (i) the terms and conditions of the requested Loan Modification Offer and (ii) the date on which such Loan Modification Offer is requested to become effective (which shall not be less than ten Business Days nor more than 30 Business Days after the date of such notice, unless otherwise agreed to by the Administrative Agent).  Permitted Amendments shall become effective only with respect to the Loans and Commitments of the Lenders that accept the applicable Loan Modification Offer (such Lenders, the Accepting Lenders) and, in the case of any Accepting Lender, only with respect to such Lenders Loans and Commitments as to which such Lenders acceptance has been made. With respect to all Permitted Amendments consummated by the Borrower pursuant to this Section, (i) such Permitted Amendments shall not constitute voluntary or mandatory payments or prepayments for purposes of Section 2.07 and (ii) any Loan Modification Offer, unless contemplating a Maturity Date already in effect hereunder pursuant to a previously consummated Permitted Amendment, must be in a minimum amount of $25,000,000, provided that the Borrower may at its election specify as a condition (a Minimum Extension Condition) to consummating any such Permitted Amendment that a minimum amount (to be determined and specified in the relevant Loan Modification Offer in the Borrowers sole discretion and which may be waived by the Borrower) of Commitments or Loans be extended.  If the aggregate principal amount of Commitments or Loans in respect of which Lenders shall have accepted the relevant Loan Modification Offer shall exceed the maximum aggregate principal amount of Commitments or Loans offered to be extended by the Borrower pursuant to such Loan Modification Offer, then the Commitments and Loans of such Lenders shall be extended ratably up to such maximum amount based on the relative principal amounts (but not to exceed actual holdings of record) with respect to which such Lenders have accepted such Loan Modification Offer."
