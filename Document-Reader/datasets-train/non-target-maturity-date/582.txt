"(b) The Guarantors hereby agree that their obligations hereunder shall be as if they were each principal debtor and not merely surety, unaffected by, and irrespective of, any invalidity, irregularity or unenforceability of any Note or this Indenture, any failure to enforce the provisions of any Note or this Indenture, any waiver, modification or indulgence granted  to  the  Issuer  with  respect  thereto  by  the  Holders  or  the  Trustee,  or  any  other circumstance which may otherwise constitute a legal or an equitable discharge of a surety or guarantor  (except  payment  in  full);  provided,  that  notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  no  such waiver,  modification,  indulgence  or  circumstance  shall  without  the  written  consent  of  the Guarantors increase the principal amount of a Note or the interest rate thereon or change the currency  of  payment  with  respect  to  any  Note,  or  alter  the  Stated  Maturity  thereof.  The Guarantors hereby waive diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of merger or bankruptcy of the Issuer, any right to require that the Trustee pursue  or  exhaust  its  legal  or  equitable  remedies  against  the  Issuer  prior  to  exercising  its rights under a Guarantee (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any right which a Guarantor may have to require the seizure and sale of the assets of the Issuer to satisfy the outstanding principal  of,  interest  on  or  any  other  amount  payable  under  each  Note  prior  to  recourse against such Guarantor or its assets), protest or notice with respect to any Note or the Debt evidenced thereby and all demands whatsoever, and each covenant that their Guarantee will not be discharged with respect to any Note except by payment in full of the principal thereof and interest thereon or as otherwise provided in this Indenture, including Section 10.04. If at any  time  any  payment  of  principal  of,  premium,  if  any,  interest,  if  any,  or  Additional Amounts, if any, on such Note is rescinded or must be otherwise restored or returned upon the  insolvency,  bankruptcy  or  reorganization  of  the  Issuer,  the  Guarantors  obligations hereunder with respect to such payment shall be reinstated as of the date of such rescission, restoration or returns as though such payment had become due but had not been made at such times."
