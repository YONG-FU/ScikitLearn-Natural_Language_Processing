"Interest shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.  The interest  so  payable,  and  punctually  paid  or  duly  provided  for,  on  any  Interest  Payment  Date  will,  as provided in the Agreement, be paid to the Person in whose name this Note (or one or more Predecessor Notes) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest, which shall be the third day (whether or not a Business Day) immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date.  After an Event of Default (as defined in the Agreement) has occurred and is continuing, the entire outstanding principal amount of the Notes and any overdue amount with respect to the Notes will accrue interest at 2% per annum plus the Applicable Interest Rate on the Notes until such time as all such Events of Default shall have been cured, which sums shall be payable following an Event of Default under Section 8.1(a)(i), Section 8.1(a)(ii), Section 8.1(a)(iv) or Section 8.1(a)(vii) (the Additional Interest).  In no event shall interest  (as  such  term  is  defined  in  Section  347  of  the  Criminal  Code  of  Canada)  on  the  credit advanced (as defined therein) hereunder be payable by the Issuer in excess of sixty percent (60%) per annum and if the Issuer does pay an amount of interest in excess of sixty percent (60%) in any particular year, the amount of such excess shall be repaid by the Holder to the Issuer.  For the purposes of this Note, whenever interest is calculated on the basis of a period which is less than the actual number of days in a calendar  year,  each  rate  of  interest  determined  pursuant to such  calculation  is, for the  purposes  of the Interest Act (Canada), equivalent to such rate multiplied by the actual number of days in the calendar year in  which  such  rate  is  to  be  ascertained  and  divided  by  the  number  of  days  used  as  the  basis  of  such calculation.  The parties acknowledge and agree that all calculations of interest under this Note are to be made on the basis of the nominal interest rate described herein and not on the basis of effective yearly rates or on any other basis which gives effect to the principle of deemed reinvestment of interest.  The parties acknowledge that there is a material difference between the stated nominal interest rates and the effective yearly rates of interest and that they are capable of making the calculations required to determine such effective yearly rates of interest."
