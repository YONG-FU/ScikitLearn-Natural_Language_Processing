"(i) The aggregate principal amount of Revolving Loans outstanding at any time to the Borrowers shall not exceed the difference between (x) the Total Revolving Credit Commitment  and  (y) the  aggregate  Letter  of  Credit  Obligations.  The  Revolving  Credit Commitment of each Lender shall automatically and permanently be reduced to zero on the Final Maturity Date.  Within the foregoing  limits, the Borrowers may borrow, repay and reborrow, the Revolving  Loans  on or after the Effective Date and  prior to  the Final Maturity Date,  subject to the terms, provisions and limitations set forth herein.  No Revolving Loans shall be advanced on the  Effective Date.  Anything  to  the  contrary  in  this  Section 2.01  notwithstanding,  the  Agents shall have the right (but not the obligation) to establish Bank Product Reserves from time to time against  the  aggregate  Revolving  Credit  Commitments  in  an  aggregate  amount  bearing  a reasonable,  good faith  relationship  to  the exposure of the  applicable Bank Product Providers  in relation to such Bank Product Obligations."
