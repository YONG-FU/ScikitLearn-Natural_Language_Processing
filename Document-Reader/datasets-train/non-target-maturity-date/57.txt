"Administrative Agent, to the Administrative Agent such legal opinions, board resolutions, secretarys certificates, officers certificates and other documents as shall reasonably be requested by the Administrative Agent in connection therewith and (iv) any applicable Minimum Extension Condition shall be satisfied (unless waived by the Borrower).  The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender as to the effectiveness of each Loan Modification Agreement.  Each Loan Modification Agreement may, without the consent of any Lender other than the applicable Accepting Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent, to give effect to the provisions of this Section, including any amendments necessary to treat the applicable Loans and/or Commitments of the Accepting Lenders as a new class of loans and/or commitments hereunder (and the Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent to enter into any such amendments); provided that all prepayments of Loans and all reductions of Commitments shall continue to be made on a ratable basis among all Lenders, based on the relative amounts of their Loans and/or Commitments (i.e., both extended and non-extended), until the repayment of the non- extended Loans on the relevant Maturity Date and/or termination of the non-extended Commitments.  The Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereby acknowledge that the minimum borrowing, pro rata borrowing and pro rata payment requirements contained elsewhere in this Agreement are not intended to apply to the transactions effected pursuant to this Section 2.14.  This Section 2.14 shall supersede any provisions in Section 2.12 or Section 9.02 to the contrary."
