"(b) the Issuer, Successor Issuer or Guarantor are, or on the next Interest Payment Date in respect of the Notes would be, required to pay any Additional Amounts, and such obligation cannot be  avoided  by  taking  reasonable  measures  available  to  the  Issuer,  Successor  Issuer  or  Guarantor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable and not result in any material legal or regulatory burden or any significant additional costs but not including assignment of the obligation to make payment with respect to the Notes). In the case of  redemption  due  to  withholding  as  a  result  of  a  Change  in  Tax  Law  in  a  jurisdiction  that  is  a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction at the date of the Final Offering Memorandum, such Change in Tax Law must  become  effective  on  or  after  the  date  of  the  Final  Offering  Memorandum.  In  the  case  of redemption due to withholding as a result of a Change in Tax Law in a jurisdiction that becomes a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction after the date of the Final Offering Memorandum, such Change in Tax Law  must  become  effective  on  or  after  the  date  the  jurisdiction  becomes  a  Relevant  Taxing Jurisdiction, unless the Change in Tax Law would have applied to the predecessor of the Successor Issuer. Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described  in  Section  3.03  of  the  Indenture.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  no  such  notice  of redemption will be given (a) earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obliged to make such payment of Additional Amounts if a payment in respect of the Notes were then  due  and  (b)  unless  at  the  time  such  notice  is  given,  such  obligation  to  pay  such  Additional Amounts  remains  in  effect.  Prior  to  the  publication  or  mailing  of  any  notice  of  redemption  of  the Notes  pursuant  to  the  foregoing,  the  Issuer  or  Successor  Issuer  will  deliver  to  the  Trustee  (a)  an Officers Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right so to redeem have been satisfied and that it would not be able to avoid the obligation to pay Additional Amounts by taking reasonable measures available to it and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognized standing to the effect that  the  Issuer,  Successor  Issuer  or  Guarantor  has  or  have  been  or  will  become  obligated  to  pay Additional  Amounts  as  a  result  of  a  Change  in  Tax  Law.  The  Trustee  will  accept  such  Officers Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders."
