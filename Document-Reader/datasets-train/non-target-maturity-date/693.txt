"(c) The obligations and liabilities of each French Guarantor under this Article 11 for the obligations  under  the  Note  Documents  of  any  other  Guarantor  which  is  its  Subsidiary  shall  not  be limited and shall therefore cover all amounts due by such Guarantor as a Guarantor.  However, where such  Subsidiary  is  itself  a  Guarantor  which  guarantees  the  obligations  of  a  member  of  the  Group which  is  not  a  Subsidiary  of  the  relevant  French  Guarantor,  the  amounts  payable  by  such  French Guarantor under this Section 11 in respect of the obligations of such Subsidiary as Guarantor shall be limited as set out under this Article 11. Section 11.04  Limitation on Guarantor Liability of Swiss Guarantors."
