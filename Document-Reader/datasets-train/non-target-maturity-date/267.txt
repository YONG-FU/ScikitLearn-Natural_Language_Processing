"Subject to this Clause 13, a Facility Borrower may select an Interest Period of one  (1),  two  (2)  or  three  (3)  Months  or  any  other  period  agreed  between  the Parent and the Agent (acting on the instructions of all Lenders) in relation to the relevant Loan.  In addition, a Co-Borrower may select an Interest Period of less than one (1) Month if necessary to ensure there are Term Loans (with an aggregate  amount  equal  to  or  greater  than  the  Repayment  Instalment)  under the Term Facility which have an Interest Period ending on a Repayment Date relating  to  the  Term  Facility  for  such  Co-Borrower  to  make  the  Repayment Instalment due on that date."
