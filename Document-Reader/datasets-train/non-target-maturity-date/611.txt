"The  Company  may,  at  its  option,  upon  notice  as  provided  below,  prepay  at  any time  all,  or  from  time  to  time  any  part  of,  the  Notes,  in  an  amount  not  less  than  5%  of  the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding in the case of a partial prepayment, at 100%  of  the  principal  amount  so  prepaid,  and  the  Make-Whole  Amount  determined  for  the prepayment date with respect to such principal amount.  The Company will give each Noteholder written notice of each optional prepayment under this Section 8.2 not less than 30 days and not more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for such prepayment.  Each such notice shall specify such  date  (which  shall  be  a  Business  Day),  the  aggregate  principal  amount  of  the  Notes  to  be prepaid on such date, the principal amount of each Note held by such Noteholder to be prepaid (determined in accordance with Section 8.3), and the interest to be paid on the prepayment date with respect to such principal amount being prepaid, and shall be accompanied by a certificate of a  Responsible  Officer  of  the  Company  as  to  the  estimated  Make-Whole  Amount  due  in connection  with  such  prepayment  (calculated  as  if  the  date  of  such  notice  were  the  date  of  the prepayment),  setting  forth  the  details  of  such  computation.    Two  Business  Days  prior  to  such prepayment, the Company shall deliver to each Noteholder a certificate of a Responsible Officer of  the  Company  specifying  the  calculation  of  such  Make-Whole  Amount  as  of  the  specified prepayment date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as no Default or Event of Default shall then exist, any prepayment made by the Company pursuant to this Section 8.2 of all of the Notes then outstanding on or after August 5, 2022 shall be made at 100% of the principal so prepaid, but without any Make-Whole Amount."
