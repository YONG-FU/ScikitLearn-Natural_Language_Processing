"Other  Remedies.  If  an  Event  of  Default  occurs  and  is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or  to  enforce  any  other  proper  remedy.  Subject  to  the  Intercreditor  Agreement,  the  RSA Intercreditor Agreement and any additional intercreditor agreement, the Trustee may direct the Security Agent to take enforcement action with respect to the Collateral if any amount is declared or becomes due and payable pursuant to Section 6.02 (but not otherwise)."
