"Licensing Collateral Test means, as of any date of determination, a test that is satisfied on such date if the aggregate contracted for licensing revenue under Material Licensing Agreements in effect on such date for the period beginning on such date of determination and ending on the Maturity Date (the test period) would, if received by Borrower as required under such agreements, result in cumulative Consolidated Excess Cash Flow in an amount that is 175% of the aggregate principal amount of the Loans outstanding on such determination date.  In order for the Licensing Collateral Test to be satisfied on any date of determination, the Borrower shall provide the Administrative Agent with a detailed calculation of cumulative Consolidated Excess Cash Flow for the test period and such other information as the Administrative Agent may request (including all assumptions used by the Borrower in making such calculation) and such calculation and assumptions shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent."
