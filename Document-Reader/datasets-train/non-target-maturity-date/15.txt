"Administrative  Agent  shall  pay  any  such  Tax  to  the  relevant  Tax  Authority  before  the  date  on  which penalties  attach  thereto  and  (ii)  if  such  Tax  is  a  Reimbursable  Tax,  the  sum  payable  by  Company  in respect of which the relevant deduction or withholding is required shall by way of additional interest be increased  to  the  extent  necessary  to  ensure  that  after  any  such  deduction  or  withholding,  the Administrative Agent or such Holder, as the case may be, and each of their Tax Related Persons receives on the due date a net sum equal to what it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been required.  If the Administrative Agent or the Company should make any deduction or withholding pursuant to this clause (a), the Company shall within 30 days thereafter forward to such Holder (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) an official receipt or other official document evidencing payment of such deduction or withholding along with a statement to Administrative Agent and such Holder, setting forth the amount of such Taxes so deducted or withheld, the applicable rate and any other information or documentation which such Holder may reasonably request for assisting such Holder or its Tax Related Person  to  obtain  any  allowable  credits  or  deductions  for  the  Taxes  so  deducted  or  withheld  in  the jurisdiction or jurisdictions in which such Holder or its Tax Related Person is subject to Tax."
