"agrees  with  each  Finance  Party  that  if  any  obligation  guaranteed  by  it  is  or becomes unenforceable, invalid or illegal, it will, as an independent and primary obligation,  indemnify  that  Finance  Party  immediately  on  demand  against  any cost, loss or liability  it  incurs as a result of an Obligor not paying any  amount which  would,  but  for  such  unenforceability,  invalidity  or  illegality,  have  been payable by it under any Finance Document on the date when it would have been due.  The amount payable by a Guarantor under this indemnity will not exceed the  amount  it  would  have  had  to  pay  under  this  Clause 23  (Guarantee  and indemnity)  if  the  amount  claimed  had  been  recoverable  on  the  basis  of  a guarantee."
