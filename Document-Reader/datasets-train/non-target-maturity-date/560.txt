"(d) For  purposes  of  determining  compliance  with  any  restriction  on  the incurrence of Debt in Sterling where Debt is denominated in a different currency, the amount of such Debt will be the Sterling Equivalent determined on the date of such determination, provided that if any such Debt denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to Sterling) covering principal amounts payable on such Debt, the amount of such Debt expressed in Sterling shall be adjusted to take into account the effect of such  agreement.  The  principal  amount  of  any  Permitted  Refinancing  Debt  incurred  in  the same  currency  as  the  Debt  being  refinanced  shall  be  the  Sterling  Equivalent  of  the  Debt refinanced  determined  on  the  date  such  Debt  being  refinanced  was  initially  incurred. Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  this  Section  4.06,  for  purposes  of  determining compliance  with  this  Section  4.06,  increases  in  Debt  solely  due  to  fluctuations  in  the exchange  rates  of  currencies  will  not  be  deemed  to  exceed  the  maximum  amount  that  the Issuer or a Guarantor may incur under this Section 4.06."
