"Notes: (1) - TPF share is based on TPF's share of allocated available proceeds as of the most recent appraisal.  Debt sharing % may differ from the partnership ownership  percentage due to preferences or other special allocations of proceeds specified in the partnership agreement.  Percentage will be updated upon each appraisal. (2) - TPF share assumes  pro-rata allocation of all items in accordance w/pship  interests, based on pari passu partnership agreement. (3) - Partner's proceeds are to be used to pay-off the amount partner borrowed from LOC to fund partner's share of contributions.  The remainder of the debt is split based on waterfall sharing. (4) - Per the terms of the JV agreement, the other partner is fully responsible for debt repayment, so  the TPF allocable percentage is 0%."
