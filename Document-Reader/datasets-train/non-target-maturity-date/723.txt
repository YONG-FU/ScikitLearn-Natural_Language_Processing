"(g) Note Purchaser Option to Decline.  Upon receipt of the notice described in Section 2.05(e), each Note Purchaser may exercise the option to decline any mandatory prepayment (other than with respect to a prepayment under Section 2.05(b) or Section 2.05(c)(i)) by giving written notice to the Issuer and the Note Purchasers of its election to do so on or before the second Business Day prior to the Applicable Prepayment Date (it being understood that any Note Purchaser which does not notify the Issuer and the Note Purchasers of its election to exercise such option on or before the second Business Day prior to the Applicable Prepayment Date shall be deemed to have elected, as of such date, not to exercise such option to decline).  On the Applicable Prepayment Date, (i) the Issuer shall pay to each Note Purchaser the amount of the mandatory prepayment due less the amount  of  Declined  Proceeds  (as  hereinafter  defined),  which  amount  shall  be  applied  as  a prepayment of the Notes of those Note Purchasers that have elected to accept such mandatory prepayment  (each,  an  Accepting  Purchaser),  and  (ii) the  Issuer  may  retain  a  portion  of  the mandatory prepayment in an amount equal to that portion of the mandatory prepayment otherwise payable to those Note Purchasers that have elected to exercise such option to decline such mandatory prepayment (such declined amounts, the Declined Proceeds).  Such Declined Proceeds retained by the Issuer may be used for general corporate purposes."
