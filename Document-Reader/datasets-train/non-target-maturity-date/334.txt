"(h) Participations.  Each Lender shall have the right at any time to sell one or more participations to any Person that provides to Company the information prior to such sale as requested by the Company in accordance with Section 10.6(d) and whose involvement in the Credit Documents, the Collateral  or  the  Obligations  of  the  Credit  Parties  in  connection  therewith  could  not  reasonably  be expected to constitute grounds for disqualification of Company or any Subsidiary from any project on account  of  NISPOM  (other  than  (i) Holdings,  any  of  its  Subsidiaries  or  any  of  its  Affiliates,  (ii)  a Disqualified Lender so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, or (iii) a Disqualified FOCI  Lender  or  any  Denied  Person)  in  all  or  any  part  of  its  Commitments,  Loans  or  in  any  other Obligation.  The documentation for any such participation shall provide that the Lender retains all rights to enforce this Agreement except that the holder of any such participation, shall not be entitled to require such  Lender  to  take  or  omit  to  take  any  action  hereunder  except  with  respect  to  any  amendment, modification or waiver that would (i) extend the final scheduled maturity of any Loan, Note or Letter of Credit  (unless  such  Letter  of  Credit  is  not  extended  beyond  the  Revolving  Commitment  Termination Date)  in  which  such  participant  is  participating,  or  reduce  the  rate  or  extend  the  time  of  payment  of interest or fees thereon (except in connection with a waiver of applicability of any post default increase in interest  rates)  or  reduce  the  principal  amount  thereof,  or  increase  the  amount  of  the  participants participation over the amount thereof then in effect (it being understood that a waiver of any Default or Event  of  Default  or  of  a  mandatory  reduction  in  the  Commitment  shall  not  constitute  a  change  in  the terms of such participation, and that an increase in any Commitment or Loan shall be permitted without the  consent  of  any  participant  if  the  participants  participation  is  not  increased  as  a  result  thereof), (ii) consent to the assignment or transfer by any Credit Party of any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement, or (iii) release all or substantially all of the Collateral under the Collateral Documents or all or substantially all of the Guarantors from the Guaranty (in each case, except as expressly provided in the Credit Documents) supporting the Loans hereunder in which such participant is participating.  Company agrees that each participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.17(c), 2.18 and 2.19 (subject to the  requirements  and  limitations  therein,  including  the  requirements  under  Section 2.19(g))to  the  same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to clause (c) of this Section; provided, (i) a participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.18 or 2.19 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such participant, unless the sale of the participation to such participant is made with Companys prior written consent (given in its sole discretion), and (ii) a participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.19 unless Company is notified of the participation sold to such participant and such participant agrees, for the benefit of Company, to comply with Section 2.19 as though it were a Lender.  To the extent permitted by law, each participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.4 as though it were a Lender, provided such participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.16 as though it were a Lender.  Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely  for  this  purpose  as  an  agent  of  Company,  maintain  a  register  on  which  it  enters  the  name  and address of each participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each participants interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Credit Documents (the Participant Register); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity  of  any  participant  or  any  information  relating  to  a  participant's  interest  in  any  commitments, loans,  letters  of  credit  or  its  other  obligations  under  any  Credit  Document)  to  any  Person  except  with respect to DSS disclosure matters and to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner"
