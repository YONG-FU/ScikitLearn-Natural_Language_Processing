(a)  The  Borrower  and  any  one  or  more  Lenders  (including  New Lenders)  may  from  time  to  time  establish  one  or  more  new  term  loan commitments (which may be in the form of an increase or addition to the existing Loans or a new tranche of term loans) pursuant to which the applicable Lenders will make term loans to the Borrower which loans shall be secured on a pari passu basis  with  the  Loans  (the  Incremental  Term  Loans)  by  executing  and delivering  to  the  Administrative  Agent  an  Increased  Facility  Activation  Notice specifying  (i)  the  amount  of  such  Incremental  Term  Loans,  (ii)  the  applicable Increased  Facility  Closing  Date  and  (iii)  (A)  the  amortization  schedule  for  such Incremental  Term  Loans,  (B)  the  Applicable  Margin  for  such  Incremental  Term Loans,  (C)  the  maturity  date  for  such  Incremental  Term  Loans  which  maturity date shall not be prior to the maturity date of the Loans made on the Closing Date and (D) any other terms applicable to the Incremental Term Loans; provided, that, if the total yield (calculated for both the Incremental Term Loans and the Loans, including the upfront fees, any interest rate floors and any OID (as defined below but  excluding  any  arrangement,  underwriting  or  similar  fee  paid  by  the Borrower))  in  respect  of  any  Incremental  Term  Loans  exceeds  by  more  than 0.50% per annum  the total  yield for the existing Loans (it being  understood that any such increase may take the form of original issue discount (OID), with OID being equated to the interest rates in a manner determined by the Administrative Agent  based  on  an  assumed  four-year  life  to  maturity),  then  the  Applicable Margin for the Loans shall be increased so that the total  yield in respect  of such Incremental Term Loans is no more than 0.50% higher than the total yield for the existing  Loans.    Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  (1)  the  aggregate  principal amount  of  borrowings  of  Incremental  Term  Loans  shall  not  exceed  (x) $25,000,000  plus  (y)  so  long  as  the  Leverage  Ratio  (calculated  on  a  pro  forma basis  after  giving  effect  to  such  Incremental  Term  Loans  and  any  transactions funded with the proceeds of such Incremental Term Loans) does not exceed 2.50 to  1.00  as  of  the  last  day  of  the  fiscal  quarter  most  recently  ended  for  which financial  statements  are  available,  $50,000,000,  (2)  without  the  consent  of  the Administrative Agent, (x) each increase effected pursuant to this Section 2.23(a)
