provided  that  where  the  Facility  Agent  and  the  Borrower  agree  any amendments  to  the  Proposed  Adjustments  during  the  Adjustment  Objection Consultation Period (such amended Proposed Adjustments being the Agreed Adjustments), the Proposed Adjustments will be unwound or otherwise varied so that the Agreed Adjustments take effect. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of Clauses 17 (Margin Covenants), 15.30 (Shares) and 20 (Events of Default) will continue to apply at all times.
